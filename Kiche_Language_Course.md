# Introduction: The K'iche' Language

K’iche’ is a Mayan language spoken by more than one million people in the highlands and piedmont of Guatemala. A country the size of the state of Tennessee, Guatemala boasts an amazing cultural and linguistic diversity with twenty-three Mayan languages in addition to Xinka, Garífuna and Spanish (See Fig. 1).

![Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Course_page_pic1.png)Figure 1. Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala

Among the Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala K’iche’ has by far the largest number of speakers -about one and a half million- and is one of the most diverse dialectally. Dialectal differences play a crucial cultural role as local ethnic and stylistic markers (See Fig. 2).

![Map of K'iche' dialects](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-2.jpg)Figure 2. Dialect geography of K’ichee’

K’iche’ was the language spoken by the ruling lineages of the K’iche’ confederacy, the most powerful polity encountered by the Spanish when they invaded the western highlands in the 1523 (See Fig. 3).

![Figure 3. View of the remains of the acropolis of Q’umarkaaj, seat of the K’iche’ confederacy \(Sergio Romero\) ](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-3.jpg)Figure 3. View of the remains of the acropolis of Q’umarkaaj,  
seat of the K’iche’ confederacy (Sergio Romero)

Some of the most important colonial documents in Mayan languages such as the Popol Vuh, the Título de Totonicapán, the Rabinal Achi and the Theologia Indorum were written in K’iche’ (See Fig. 4).

![Manuscript copy of the Theologia Indorum ](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-4.jpg)Figure 4. Manuscript copy of the Theologia Indorum  
(American Philosophical Society)

K’iche’ speakers from what is now the department of Totonicapán were central protagonists in the national movement leading to independence from Spain in 1821. More recently, Adrian Inés Chávez, a K’iche’ from San Francisco el Alto, was one of the intellectual forefathers of the Maya Movement. His translation and interpretation of the Popol Vuh as a pan-Maya cultural and spiritual Bible, is still influential in Maya political discourse and ritual practice. In the 1970s and 80s some of the most active members of peasant organizations such as the _Comité the Unidad Campesina_ (CUC) and revolutionary groups such as the _Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca_ (URNG) were K’iche’ speakers too. The emblematic Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Nobel Prize Winner in 1992, is a K’iche’ woman from Uspantán in the department of Quiché. Finally, Humberto Akabal, the best-known and innovative Maya poet today, is a K’iche’ speaker from Momostenango (See Fig. 5).

![Humberto Akabal](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Figure-5.jpg)Figure 5. Humberto Akabal

His prolific work in K’iche’ attests to the lexical and stylistic richness of Mayan languages and is iconic of the Maya Movement today. K’iche’ is without a doubt the most emblematic Mayan language in Guatemala, a vehicle of resistance and change since 1523.

### How to use this online course

These online lessons provide a detailed introduction to the sounds, grammar and practice of speaking K’iche’. Based on the variety spoken in the township of Nahualá in the department of Sololá (See Fig. 6), they are meant to develop students’ oral, reading and writing skills as well as a firm grasp of the grammar. We also introduce topics of cultural relevance where necessary. Needless to say, K’iche’ embodies K’iche’ culture and values and some understanding of the latter is necessary for any progress in linguistic competence. These lessons will be an excellent resource for K’iche’ learners but they are not meant to replace interaction with actual speakers, however.

Each of the forty lessons starts with a story, a conversation or a song illustrating the vocabulary and grammar topics developed in the lesson. The lesson sequence starts with useful everyday vocabulary and phrases and progressively introduces more complex phrasings. Learners are encouraged to read the texts aloud following the audio provided. Although certain sounds may be unfamiliar, we encourage them to try their best. They should seek communicational ease rather than perfect diction. Several grammar and drills sections follow the head story. The drills should be read/answered aloud as well as written down. Most K’iche’ words will sound strange for beginning students who are not speakers of Mayan languages. With practice it will become easier to recognize and learn new words, however. K’iche’ grammar may appear challenging at first. It is quite different from the grammar of standard average Indo-European languages such as English and Spanish but is not especially complex. We strove to develop grammar explanations both pedagogically adequate and linguistically accurate.

Because K’iche’ shows a substantial dialectal variation beginners may initially find some difficulty in understanding non-Nahualá dialects. Nevertheless, they should not feel discouraged. With practice they will able to adapt to regional difference. As mentioned earlier, dialectal differences act as ethnic markers and learners should develop the ability to identify them. Standard K’iche’ -used in K’iche’ publications- is quite similar to the Nahualá variety so learners will not have difficulty in reading recently published materials.

Introduction

This unit introduces the sounds of K’iche’. The goal is to become familiar, first, with the pronunciation of consonants and vowels and, second, with the spelling conventions that are used to write K’iche’. Do not worry if your pronunciation is not perfect. You will improve with practice throughout the course.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Jas kab’an che ub’ixik le K’iche’ ch’ab’al (The sounds of K’iche)**

Most of the sounds of K’iche’ will not be challenging for a speaker of English or Spanish, as the reader will soon discover. The series of ejective consonants (b’, t’, k’, q’) will be a bit harder to articulate, but with patience and practice they can be mastered too. It should be noted that vowel length is important as several words are distinguished only by the length of their vocalic articulation. For example, the _ä_ in _chäj_ “pine tree” is short, while the _a_ in  _chaj_ “ashes” is long. Short vowels will be spelt with a dieresis diacritic (¨) as in the previous example _chäj_. We encourage the reader not to feel discouraged if her or his pronunciation is not exactly like a native speaker’s. In this course, we strive to develop communicational competence, not “perfect articulation”! Your pronunciation will improve as you continue to practice and engage with native speakers. Begin by reading the words below and then click on the examples and listen carefully. Repeat the words aloud until you feel comfortable with your pronunciation.

**The sounds of K’iche’  
**Some features of K’iche’ consonants and vowels are quite different from those of most Indo-European languages. The most striking are a glottalized series of consonants (ejectives) as well as the presence of both short and long vowels. Vowels are sometimes followed by a closure of the glottis (glottal stop) in which case they are followed by an apostrophe (‘).

p |  t | ch | tz | k | q | ‘  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
b’ | t’ | ch’ | tz’ | k’ | q’ |   
| s |  |  |  j | x |   
m | n |  |  |  |  |   
| l l (final word position) |  |  |  |  |   
| r |  |  |  |  |   
w |  |  |  y |  |  |

In addition to the phonemes shown above, K’iche’ has borrowed some Spanish phonemes (b, f, d, g), which are restricted to Spanish loanwords such as the following:

bas drinking glass

bin wine

botax boots

doctor doctor

dyos God (the Christian deity)

parmas pharmacy, drug store

grad staircase, steps

**Vowels**

K’iche’ has a ten-vowel vocalic inventory, as seen in Figure 2. Vowel length is phonemic, in other words, it indicates different words. As we have seen, short vowels are distinguished from long vowels by a two dot diacritic. Note that vowel length is only important on stressed syllables (in other words, the accented syllable of each word). Most K’iche’ dialects stress word-final syllables only, including the Nahuala dialect.

This is Tara. She is from the city of Boston in the United States. She’s a student of K’iche’ in the town of Nahualá. This is how she greets Nan Mariy in K’iche’:

KEMCHI’Grammar

The following are common greetings:

Saqirik! | Good morning!  
---|---  
Xb’e q’ij! | Good afternoon!  
Xok aq’ab’! | Good evening!  
Jeb’a’! | Good bye!  
Tat | Sir  
Nan | Ma’am  
Ala | Boy  
Ali | Girl  
Saqirik tat! | Good morning, sir!  
Xb’e q’ij nan! | Good afternoon, ma’am!  
Xok aq’ab’ ali! | Good evening, girl!  
  
**Social status and greetings in K’iche’**  
K’iche’ greetings change based on the speakers and the context. There are formal and colloquial greetings. In Nahualá, formal address is required to engage town elders, family in-laws, school teachers, church leaders (Catholic priests, catechists, Evangelical pastors) as well as civil authorities (town mayor, departmental governor, and other high government officials). Formal address is also used to address God and other divine beings in religious rituals. It is required to address adult audiences in public functions such as school graduations, political speeches, and masses. Finally, it is commonly used in radio broadcasts to address listeners. Colloquial forms are expected in informal conversations between kin (except between in-laws) as well as between friends. They are also used in market transactions and in brief exchanges between strangers of the same social status.

Watch each of the following short videos paying special attention to the greetings the speakers utilize.

#### Informal greeting

# Tïjonïk 4: Are wa' nuwuj! (This is my book!) – K'iche nominal possessive markers

Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about nominal possession in K’iche’. It is a bit more intricate than English or Spanish as K’iche’ has a very rich word morphology. You will have plenty of examples and drills!

TZIJONIKText

In the following videos, students practice the possessive markers with tat Wel. Do you notice a difference between the two?

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Possession**

In K’iche’ nominal possession markers are prefixed on the possessed person/object. Different sets of prefixes are used with consonant-initial nouns and with vowel-initial nouns. The exception is formal address, in which the post-nominal particles _la_ (sing.) or _alaq_ (plural) are used instead of prefixes. See the examples in the table below:

****Before a consonant  
******  
** | **rajil** “money” | ****Before a vowel**** | **achi’l** “friend”  
---|---|---|---  
**nu** -rajil | my money | **w** -achi’il | my friend  
**a** -rajil | your money | **aw** -achi’il | your friend  
rajil****la**** | your money (formal) |  achi’l **la** |  your friend (formal)  
**u** -rajil | his/her money | **r-** achi’il | his/her friend  
**qa** -rajil | our money | **q** -achi’il | our friend  
**i** -rajil | your money (pl. informal) | **iw** -achi’il | your friend (pl. informal)  
rajil **alaq** | your money (pl. formal) | achi’l **alaq** | your friend (pl. formal)  
**ki** -rajil  | their money | **k** -achi’il  | their friend  
  
**Inherent possession (-Vl)  
**A certain class of K’iche’ nouns may take an additional /-Vl/ suffix. This is known as inherent possession and marks a part-whole relationship between possessor and possessed object/person. For example, there is a semantic difference between _nub’aq_ and _nub’aqil_. The former references bones that are not part of the possessor’s body, chicken bones used to make soup, for example. The latter, in contrast, means “my body” which references the possessor’s own body. Some nouns take only inherent possession markers (wife, husband), others may take both (bone, house). The large majority of nouns do not take inherent possession markers, however. A few nouns take irregular possessed forms such as house (_ja_ when not possessed, _-ochoch_ when possessed).

**Preconsonantal** | **b’aq** ‘bone’ | **Prevocalic** | **ixoq** ‘woman’ | –**o’ch** | ‘house’  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
**nu-** b’aq**-il** | my body | **w** -ixoq-il | my wife | **w-** o’ch | my house  
**a-** b’aq**-il** | your body | **aw** -ixoq-**il** | your wife | **aw** -o’ch | your house  
b’aq-il **la** | your body (formal) | ixoq**-il la** | your wife (formal) | o’ch **la** | your house (formal)  
**u-** b’aq**-il** | his/her/its body | **r** -ixoq-**il** | his/her wife | **r** -o’ch**** | his/her house  
**qa** -b’aqi-**il** | our body | **q** -ixoq-**il** | our wife | **q-** o’ch | our house  
**i** -b’aq-**il** | your body (pl.) | **iw** -ixoq-**il** | your wife (pl.) | **iw** -o’ch | your house (pl.)  
b’aq-**il alaq** | your body (pl. formal) | ixoq-**il alaq** | your wife (pl. formal) | o’ch **alaq** | your house (pl. formal)

Introduction

![100_5628](http://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/100_5628-1-300x225.jpg)

K’iche’ does not have verbs equivalent to English ‘to have’ and ‘to be’, which introduce existential sentences or possession clauses such as “There is maize in the kitchen” or “I have a mean dog.” In K’iche’, as in most Mayan languages, possession and existence are denoted with a special particle called an “existential” (_k’o_ in K’iche’). The existential _k’o_ often appears in sentence or phrase initial position. In sentence-final position it is replaced with _k’olik_. In this unit you will learn how to use _k’o_ and its use in conversations.

TZIJONIKText

In the following videos, Nan Silveria and Nan Chaya tell us about the objects that are found in the kitchen.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Possession  
**The particle _k’o_ followed by a possessed noun indicates possession (which in English is expressed with the verb “to have”), as we see in the examples below:

Ex. 1  
**K’o nuwuj  
**k’o nu-wuj  
Ex my-book  
_I have a book_.  | Ex.2  
**K’o nuwa chi’.**  
k’o nu-wa chi’  
Ex my-food here  
_I have food here_.  
  
---|---  
Ex. 3  
**K’o uxajab’ ri ak’al.**  
k’o u-xajab’ ri ak’al  
Ex his-sandals det child  
_The child has sandals_.  
| Ex. 4  
**K’o qo’ch chila’ Nawalja’.**  
k’o q-o’ch chila’ Nawalja’  
Ex our-house there Nahualá  
_We have a house in Nahualá._  
  
Ex. 5  
**K’o iwab’ix pa juyub’**.  
k’o iw-ab’ix pa juyub’  
Ex y’all’s-cornfield loc hill  
_You all have a cornfield in the forest/mountain/hill.  
_ | Ex. 6  
**E k’o kik’ajol le a’chijab’**.  
e k’o ki-k’ajol le a’chij-ab’  
PL ex their-son (of man) det men-PL  
_The men have sons.  
_  
  
**Existential Sentences  
**The particle k’o also functions as an existential (which in English can be glossed as “There is/There are” or different conjugations of the verb “to be”), as we can see from the examples below:

Ex. 7  
**K’o jun ala pa tijob’al**.  
k’o jun ala pa tijob’al  
Ex one boy loc school  
_There is a boy in the school._  
| Ex. 8  
**K’o jun tz’i’ pa b’e.  
**k’o jun tz’i’ pa b’e  
Ex one dog loc road  
_There is a dog on the road_.

Ex. 9  
**At k’o pa swan**!

Introduction

In this unit, you will learn about K’iche’ pronouns. We will start with personal pronouns and how to use them in conversation. Next, you will learn how to report the location of people and objects.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Independent pronouns  
**Independent pronouns–equivalent to English personal pronouns–are used in K’iche’ as subjects of non-verbal predicates as well as for emphasis or topicalization (for example, “As for me, I am sure I’ll learn K’iche’”). They are used more sparsely than in English, however. Non-verbal predicates include stative phrases denoting states, conditions or qualities. Unlike Spanish or English, K’iche’ does not have a verb equivalent to ‘to be’. You will notice that the English translations of the example sentences below require the verb ‘to be’ as copula. In pronominal, non-verbal sentences in K’iche’, independent pronouns occupy the first slot followed by the predicate as in the following examples:

  1. In ajtij.  
I teacher  
_I am a teacher._
  2. At r-ajkun le nu-nan.  
You her-doctor art. my-mother  
_You are my mother’s doctor._
  3. Are le u-tat le al Ska’.  
He art. her-dad- art. class. Francisca  
_He is Francisca’s dad._
  4. Oj ajxojolob’ pa Awas Q’ij.  
We dancers prep. Holy Week  
_We are dancers on Holy Week._
  5. A’re e r-al le nan We’l.  
They her-children art. class. Manuela  
_They are the children of mrs. Manuela._

Look at the table of independent pronouns. Note that the pronouns are not marked for gender like in the third person in English (in other words, there is no difference between the pronoun for  _she_ and  _he_).

**********in** | I | ****oj/uj**** | we  
---|---|---|---  
**at** | you | ******ix** | you (pl)  
******lal** | you (formal) | ******alaq** | you (pl, formal)  
******are(’)** | he/she/it | ****a** ’re(’)** | they  
  
The glottal stop after “are(‘)” and “a’re(‘)” appears when phrase final.

We have already seen these pronouns, for example, in greetings:

  1. La utz awach? – Utz maltyox, e k’u ri **at**? – Utz maltyox.  
_How are you? – Well, thank you, and**you**?– Well, thank you._
  2. La utz wach la? – Utz maltyox, e k’u ri **lal**? – Utz maltyox.  
_How are you (formal) – Well, thank you, and**you**(formal)?– Well, thank you._

Let’s look at more examples:

  1. **

In** ajtij.  
I teacher  
_I am a teacher._
  2. **

At** tijoxel  
You student  
_You are a student._
  3. **

Are** utz u-na’oj  
He/she/it good his-knowledge  
_He is a good man/woman_ (she/he has good character/ buena gente).
  4. **

Lal** k’amal b’e  
you (formal) leader  
_You (formal) are a leader._

**Locative sentences  
**Locative sentences, as the name suggests, describe the location of the subject. In K’iche’, locative sentences consist of independent pronouns in the first slot followed by the existential particle _k’o_ and its locative complement, in other words, the place where the subject is. As we have seen in stative phrases, we use the verb “to be” when glossing the sentence in English. Note that if a third person subject is plural the form _e k’o_ is used (we will discuss plurals in more detail in lesson 9). If a third person is explicit, it precedes the existential _k’o_ as well. Let’s look at the following examples:

  1. **

At k’o** pa swan!  
at k’o pa swan  
You ex. prep. ravine  
_You are in the ravine!_
  2. **

Oj k’o** pa le r-o’ch le a Wel.  
we ex. prep. his-house Manuel  
_We are at Manuel’s house._
  3. **

In k’o** pa le u-k’isb’al cholaj.  
I ex. prep. its-last row/lane  
_I’m in the last row._

If the subject of the sentence is the **third person singular pronoun** , the particle **k’o** stands alone.

  1. **

K’o** pa tijob’al  
Ex. prep. school  
_He/she/it is at school._

If the subject of the sentence is the **third person plural pronoun** , **e** precedes the particle **k’o** :

  1. **

E k’o** pa tijob’al  
They ex. prep. school  
_They are at school._
  2. **

E k’o** keb’ u-k’ajol le tat Xwan  
They ex. two his-sons art. class. Juan  
_Mr. Juan has two sons._

**Emphasis, topicalization, and independent pronouns**

When the subject is topicalized or emphatic contrast is stressed, independent pronouns are copied in sentence-initial position.

  1. **

In in** k’o pa tijob’al!  
_I am the one who is at school!_
  2. **

At at** le utaqo’n le q’atal tzij!  
_You are the one who is the judge’s messenger!_
  3. **

Are le Tu’r** le loq’omanel!  
_Venturo is the one who is the buyer!_
  4. **Oj oj** wokol ja!  
_We are the ones who are construction workers!_
  5. **Ix ix** e’laq’omab’!  
_You all are the ones who are thieves!_

Greetings, students! I am happy to be with you. Today I have a speech about my hometown.

Ah, my hometown! It makes me sad when I go somewhere else, because, here, if I want to rest there’s a park. If I want to play there’s a court. If I want to walk there are beautiful places among the green forests. It is also wonderful to see the beauty of the church in the center of town, as well as the  _municipalidad_ which is next to the church. During winter the cornfields are very green, green green. They are so green they look like forests, “behind, in front, all over my hometown” when you see them once a year, having been planted by people’s hands.

When the cornfields are planted different seeds are used, there is the seed of the highlands and of the lowlands. At the end of the year people have a lot of work to do because they clean the corn that they get from the reaping of the cornfields. It looks beautiful drying in front of the houses. There is yellow corn, red corn, white corn, and speckled corn as well as black corn. I look through my window and there are white clouds moving in the sky, the bright river like a mirror that goes by my house. Then I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and I feel the fresh air in my hear. I sigh and tell myself: “There is no other place I want to be other than my hometown.”

That’s why I extend to you an invitation: come, come see what my hometown is like. Maybe you have problems; maybe you have a lot of work to do. But come spend a couple of days here. Our towns are different; come see with your own eyes “beauty’s beauty” which you haven’t seen because you can only see it in my hometown.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Non-verbal sentences.**  
Unlike Spanish and English, K’iche’ does not have a copula (to be). This means that in existential and descriptive sentences like “the man is tired,” the adjective (tired) takes on the roles as predicate; subject (man) and predicate (tired) are simply juxtaposed. In K’iche’, the predicate precedes the subject. Use _le_ as a generic article “the” (we will study articles in greater detail in another lesson).

Introduction

In this unit you will learn how to ask questions. Next, we will take a look at how to construct negative sentences, which are a bit complex in K’iche’.

Xwan: She is. She is coming.  
We’l: Thanks!  
Xwan: And your brother, is he home today?  
We’l: He’s not. He didn’t come.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Yes/no questions in K’iche’**  
In K’iche’ yes/no questions simply require placing the particle _La_ at the beginning as well as adding a raising intonation at the end. Listen carefully to the examples below.

-La k’o le atat?  
-Je’, k’olik. | -Is your dad (home)?  
-Yes, he is.  
---|---  
  
The particle  _je’_ is utilized as yes. As we have seen, the particle  _k’o_ becomes  _k’olik_ when it is in the phrase final position.

-La xukul le a Xwan?  
– Je’, xukulik. | -Is Xwan kneeling?  
-Yes, he is.  
---|---  
– La oj oj nab’e?  
– Je’, oj oj nab’e. | -Are we first?  
-Yes, we are first  
---|---  
  
Please listen to the following examples and practice answering the questions.

– La k’o awe?  
– K’olik.  
OR:  
– Je’, k’o we. | -Do you have a girlfriend/boyfriend?  
-I do.-Yes, I have a girlfriend/boyfriend.  
---|---  
– La nim le atinamit?  
– Je’ nim.  
OR:  
– Je’, nim le nutinamit. |  -Is your town big?  
-Yes, (it is) big. -Yes, my town is big.  
---|---  
– La at k’o ruk’ le atz’i’?  
– In k’olik.  
OR:  
– Je’, in k’o ruk’ le nutz’i’. | -Are you with your dog?  
-I am. -Yes, I am with my dog.  
---|---  
– La rax le juyub’?  
– Je’, rax.  
OR:  
– Je’, rax le juyub’. |  -Is the mountain green?  
-Yes, (it is) green. -Yes, the mountain is green.  
---|---  
– La k’o le ajastaq?  
– Je’, k’olik.  
OR:  
– Je’, k’o le nujastaq. | -Do you have your things?  
-Yes, I do. -Yes, I have my things.  
---|---  
– La awachalal le al We’l?  
– Je’, wachalal.  
OR:  
– Je’, wachalal le al We’l. | -Is Manuela your relative?  
-Yes, (she is)my relative.-Yes, Manuela is my relative.  
---|---  
– La ix k’o pa le tijob’al?  
– Je’ oj k’olik.  
OR:  
– Je’, oj k’o pa le tijob’al. |  -Are y’all at the school?  
-Yes, we are.-Yes, we are at the school.  
---|---  
  
**Negation in non-verbal sentences  
**In Nahuala K’iche’, the negative answer to yes/no questions is _maj_. The Spanish loanword _no’_ (with a glottal stop) is often heard as well. An answer with _maj_ alone may be interpreted as somewhat curt but sometimes it is enough. Negation in K’iche’ is periphrastic, in other words, it requires two negation markers as in French, for example. The first is the (optional) particle _na_ preceding the predicate. The second (obligatory) particle is _ta_ or _taj_ in sentence final position. Negative existential sentences in Nahuala start with _maj_ and do not carry the existential k’o/k’olik. Let’s look at some examples:

Na nim ta r-aqan wa’ we chaj.  
Negation big Negation its-leg this tree  
_This pine (tree) is not tall.  
_(Remember the construction  _nim raqan_ means tall)

Na rax ta u-wach le juyub’.  
Neg. green neg. its-face art. mountain  
_The mountain is not green._

Maj u-rajil le q’abarel.  
Neg. his/her-money art. drunk (person)  
_The drunk (person) has no money._

Na utz ta le u-t’iso’m le al Mari’y  
Neg. good neg. art. her-sewing art. class. Mari’y  
_Maria’s sewing is not good._

Na q’an ta u-wach le qa-prut  
Neg. yellow neg. its-face art. our-banana  
_Our banana is not ripe (yellow)._

Maj jab’ wa’ kamik  
Neg. rain today  
_There is no rain today._

Maj uwaq’ij iwir  
Neg. sun rays yesterday  
_There was no sun today._

Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about plural forms to reference multiple objects and people. There are several ways to pluralize words and sentences in K’iche’.

On Thursdays and Sundays, the center of Nahualá is dominated by the market. On these days, the roads are crowded with sellers and merchandise. Listen to Juan Manuel’s description of what you can find in Nahualá during market days:

Show/Hide English translation

In this photograph we can see the Nahualá market. There are many sellers: There are tomato vendors, there are vegetable vendors, there are watermelon vendors, there are clothes vendors, there are shoe vendors. We also see that there are women, men, children, and young people as the buyers. At the market, there are many workers because there are many kinds of goods being sold. When the market closes, workers store their merchandise in big houses built near the center of town. Afterwards, dogs start walking around the market, looking for food in the trash receptacles. They don’t leave until the whole market is clean.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Nouns**

Plural nouns are marked with the suffix **–Vb’** , where V = Vowel. If the last vowel of the noun is **–i** or **–e** , the plural suffix is **–ab’** :

1\. In ajtij . “I am a teacher.”

**Oj ajt****i****j****ab’.** “We are teachers.”

2\. Are tijoxel. “He/she is a student.”

**A’re’ e tijox****e****l****ab’.** “They are students.”

Note that **a’re** “they” is the plural of **are** “he/she”. When appearing as predicates of third person plural subjects, plural nouns require an agreement proclitic **e** (as in **e tijoxelab** ’ “students” in Ex. 2).

If the last vowel of the noun is **–a, -o, -u,** the plural suffix is **–ib’** :

3\. At ixoq . “You are a woman.”

**Ix ix****o****q****ib’.** “You all are women.”

4\. At ajchak.“You are a worker.”

**Ix****ajch****a****k****ib’.** “You all are workers.”

If the noun begins with a vowel, the proclitic **e** that marks plurality becomes a glottal stop inserted after the first vowel of the third person plural noun (**a’jchakib’**).

There are some exceptions to the vowel rule above. In almost of all of them, however, the meanings of the plural form are somewhat different from the singular:

5\. k’ajol “son (of a man)”

**k’aj****o****l****ab****’** “young men, male youth”

6\. ak’al “child”

**ak’****a****l****ab’** “children”

7\. ali “girl, unmarried young woman”

**altomab’** “girls”

8\. ala “boy, unmarried young man”

**alab’om** “boys”

9\. achi “man”

**achijab’** “men”

10\. ati’t “grandmother, female animal”

**ati’tab’** “female animals”

11\. ama’ “male animal”

**ama’ib’** “male animals”

**Adjectives**

Adjectives do not have plural forms except the following (the plural suffix is **-aq**)

12\. ch’uti’n / **ch’utiq** “small”

13\. nim / **nimaq** “big”

14\. chom / **chomaq** “fat”

15\. pim / **pimaq** “thick”

When the adjective is acting as sentence predicate, a glottal stop is required after the ‘a’ in **–aq**.

16\. Le **nimaq** a taq ja. “The big houses”

17\. **Nima’q** le ja. “The houses are big”

18\. **Nima’q** taq le ja. “The houses are big”

For a more in-depth explanation of adjectives see lessons 28 and 29.

**Proclitic particle ‘taq** ’

Plural nouns are marked with the proclitic **taq**.

19\. Le nimaq taq ja. “The big houses.”

b) In existential and stative sentences: When the predicate is a plural noun, the particle **taq** precedes the article. The reader should be aware that in K’iche’ predicates **precede** subjects unlike Spanish or English.

20\. Saq taq le ja. “The houses are white.”

In Ex. 20, the predicate **saq** “white” precedes the subject **taq le ja** “the houses”.

21\. Rax taq le kotz’i’j. “The flowers are green.”

22\. E k’a’n taq le tz’i’. “The dogs are fierce.”

When referencing animate nouns the agreement marker **e** before the predicate is preferred as in Ex. 22.

23\. E k’a’n le tz’i’. “The dogs are fierce.”

In example 23, the proclitic **e** is the sole plural marker as the proclitic **taq** does not appear preceding the subject **le tz’i’** “the dogs.”

24\. E utz le winaq. “The people are good.”

In like fashion, in example 24, the**** proclitic **e** before the predicate **utz** is the only plural marker.

25\. E nima’q le altomab’. “The girls are big.”

In Ex. 25 both the predicate **nima’q** and the subject **altomab’** bear plural markers.

26\. A’re wa’ le e wal. “These here are my kids” (spoken by a woman).

In example 26, the agreement proclitic **e** precedes wal “my kids.” Note the plural marking on the pronoun **a’re** “they.”

27\. A’re wa’ le e nuchikop. “These here are my animals.”

28\. E tijoxelab’ le a’chijab’. “The men are students.”

Note the agreement proclitics (**e** and glottal stop) on both plural nouns in the predicate **e tijoxelab’** and in the subject **le a’chijab’**.

29\. A’jtijab’ le achijab’. “The men are teachers.”

In contrast to Ex. 28, the subject **achijab’** does not show proclitic agreement in Ex. 29.

30\. E’laq’omab’ taq le achijab’. “The men are thieves.”

31\. E k’o kajib’ uk’ajol le tat Wel. “Don Manuel has four sons.”

32\. Jawi’ e k’o wi le awal? “Where are your children?” (addressed to a woman).

In existential sentences the proclitic **e** precedes the existential **k’o** as in Ex. 31. The cardinal number **kajib’** “four” marks the subject as plural. Possessed nouns such as **uk’ajol** “his sons” are not pluralized.

Finally, there is an additional proclitic particle with a diminutive, affective connotation that indicates affection or appreciation towards the subject: **staq,** as in Ex. 33 below. Do not confuse this with **taq** , which is a distributive/diminutive as well (Ex. 34).

33\. Kewar le **staq** imul. “The cute/little rabbits are sleeping.”

34\. Kewar le **taq** imul. “The cute/little rabbits are sleeping.”

35\. K’o **taq** ab’aj pa le b’e. “There are little rocks on the road.”

Introduction

In this lesson, we will study intransitive verbs. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to say what you do, for example, eat, sleep, and travel.

TZIJONIKText

This following text was written by a beginner K’iche’ student when asked to describe his daily routine.

Mauricio le nub’i. **Kimpe** pa le tinamit Austin, pa le amaq’ Estados Unidos. In tijoxel pa le nimatijob’al. Ronojel q’ij **kimb’e** pa le nimatijob’al. Aretaq **kinwa’lijik****kinwa’ik**.

My name is Mauricio. I am from the city of Austin in the United States. I am a student at the university. Everyday I go to the university. When I get up, I eat. Then I go to the university. I walk. I like my town. When I arrive at school, I have my K’iche’ class. My teacher’s name is tat Wel. In class, we talk with our teacher in K’iche’. I like my K’iche’ class a lot!

KEMCHI’Grammar

INTRANSITIVE VERBS

In K’iche’, there is an important distinction between the morphology of transitive and intransitive verbs. Intransitive verbs in K’iche’ include verbs referencing actions that **do not** directly affect anyone/anything except the agent (you can think about them as having a subject but not an object, if it helps). Verbs like walk, go, dance, sleep, etc. are intransitive. Verbs referencing feelings and mental states are also intransitive: dream, worry, be sad, be happy, etc.

In K’iche’ the person (agent) is marked in intransitive verbs using a set of prefixes generally known by Mayanists as “set B.”

Person | Singular | Gloss | Plural | Gloss  
---|---|---|---|---  
1st | **-in-** or **–im-** before b’ | I | **-oj-** | We  
2nd | **-at-** | You | **-ix-** | You all  
2nd (Formal) | **-la** | You (Formal) | **-alaq** | You all (Formal)  
3rd | Ø | He/she/it | **-e-** or glottal stop | They  
  
Table 1. Intransitive verb subject markers (Set B)

Ex. 1 Kimb’e pa le tinamit.  
K-im-b’e / pa / le / tinamit  
Incompletive Aspect – 1st person singular Set B – go / preposition / article / town  
_I go to (the) town._

We have already seen with constructions such as possession that K’iche’ is an agglutinative language, which means that particles attach to words to determine their meaning (for example: _tinamit, nutinamit, qatinamit_). To form a verb in K’iche’, the marker for the person that is doing the action (the agent) becomes part of the verb, as we see with the marker **_im_**(1sB: first person singular, set B) in Ex. 1 –** _B’e_** is the verb root for the verb “to go.” The ** _k-_** at the beginning marks the tense or aspect of the verb. In this case, it is in incompletive (INC) aspect; the action is taking place (this is similar, though not equivalent to what we would call the present tense in English).

Ex. 2  
La katb’e pa le tinamit?  
La / k-at-b’e / pa / le / tinamit  
INT / INC-2sB-go / prep. / art. / town  
_Are you going to town?_

In Ex. 2 the second person singular marker**– _at_ –** (2sB) precedes the verbal root **– _b’e_**. The so-called incompletive aspect marker **k-** (INC) precedes the person marker. The marker _**k-**_ references ongoing or habitual actions. Note the interrogative proclitic _**la**_ (INT) preceding the phrase. Like in the first example, _**pa**_ (prep) is a preposition and _**le**_ is an article (art).

Ex. 3  
Je’, kimb’ek.  
Je’, / k-im-b’e-k  
Yes, / INC-1sB-go-PFM  
_Yes, I am going (to town)._

When an intransitive verb comes at the end of a phrase, it takes a phrase final marker (PFM). This marker is usually **_-ik_** , though for the verb _**b’e**_ it’s just **-k**. In Ex. 3 the suffix **–k** is a phrase final marker (PFM).

As you can see in the table above, the third person singular (he/she/it) is not marked. Instead of the marker, as a place holder we’ve written as **Ø**. In Nahualá, if the intransitive verb begins with a consonant, an  _**a** _is added to the aspect marker ** _k-_ **in order to avoid having two consonants in a row. The third person singular form of “to go,” then, as you will see below, is **_kab’ek_** in phrase final position, or _**kab’e** _in a sentence such as “the student goes” “**K**** _ab’e le tijoxel_** ” where the verb is not at the end of the phrase. The formal markers for the second person singular and plural (la, alaq) actually come  _**after**_ the verb, so verbs in the formal will never have a phrase final marker. Look over the following table, where  _**b’e**_ is marked and broken down for each person:

Aspect | Person | Root |  Formal | PFM | Complete | Gloss  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
k- | in / im | b’e |  | -k | **kimb’ek** | I go  
k- | at | b’e |  | -k | **katb’ek** | you go  
ka- | — | b’e | la | — | **kab’e** **la** | you go (formal)  
ka- | Ø | b’e |  | -k |  **kab’ek** | he / she goes  
k- | oj / uj | b’e |  | -k | **kojb’ek** | we go  
k- | ix | b’e |  | -k | **kixb’ek** | you all go  
ka- | — | b’e | alaq | — | **kab’e** **alaq** | you all go (formal)  
k | e | b’e |  | -k | **keb’ek** | they go  
  
Now take a look at the verb **war(ik)** , “to sleep.” Can you predict how this verb would be marked for each person before looking at the table?

Aspect | Person | Root |  Formal | PFM | Complete | Gloss  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
k- | in / im | war |  | -ik | **kinwarik** | I sleep  
k- | at | war |  | -ik | **katwarik** | you sleep  
ka- | — | war | la | — | **kawar la** | you sleep (formal)  
ka- | Ø | war |  | -ik | **kawarik** | he / she sleeps  
k- | oj / uj | war |  | -ik | **kojwarik** | we sleep  
k- | ix | war |  | -ik | **kixwarik** | you all sleep  
ka- | — | war | alaq | — | **kawar alaq** | you all sleep (formal)  
k | e | war |  | -ik | **kewarik** | they sleep

Introduction

In this unit we will study negation in K’iche’. We will use the particles  _na_ and  _ta(j)_ to create negative sencences.

TZIJONIKText

Read the following sentences and questions along with their negative versions:

1) Kimb’e pa le juyub’.  
1a) Na kimb’e ta pa le juyub’. 1b) Na kimb’e taj.

2) Kaki’kot le tijoxel pa le tijob’al.  
2a) Na kaki’kot ta le tijoxel pa le tijob’al. 2b) Na kaki’kot taj.

3) La kixch’aw pa le ch’aweb’al?  
3a) Na kojch’aw ta pa le ch’aweb’al. 3b) Na kojch’aw taj.

4) La katzijon la kuk’ le winaq?  
4a) Na kintzijon ta kuk’ le e winaq. 4b) Na kintzijon taj.

5) La ko’pan pa le ko’ch le tijoxelab’?  
5a) Na ko’pan ta pa le ko’ch le tijoxelab’. 5b) Na ko’pan taj.

KEMCHI’Grammar

**Verb negation**

Negative clauses in K’iche’ require two negation particles: **_na_** preceding the predicate head–which can be a verb, adjective, noun or pronoun–and **_ta(j)_** following it. **_Na_** is often deleted in colloquial speech. There are two variants of the second particle: **_taj_** in phrase-final position and **_ta_** elsewhere.

To answer “no” in K’iche’, the whole verb phrase is repeated and negated.

**

La kixwarik?  
**La k-ix-warik?  
INT INC-2pl-sleep-pfm  
Are you all sleeping?

**_**

**Na_ kujwar _taj.  
_**Na k-uj-war taj  
Neg1 INC-1pl-sleep Neg2  
We aren’t sleeping.

**_**

**Na_ kujwar _ta_ waral.  
**Na k-uj-war ta waral  
Neg1 INC-1pl-sleep Neg2 here

**_**

**Na_ kawar _ta_ la.  
**Na ka-ø-war ta la

My name is Mauricio. I am from the city of Austin in the United States. I am a student at the university. Yesterday I went to the university. When I got up, I ate. Afterwards I went to the university. I walked. I like my town. When I arrived to the university, we went to our K’iche’ class. Our teacher’s name is tat Wel. In class, we talked with our teacher in K’iche’. I like my K’iche’ class a lot!

**THE AGONY OF A PEOPLE**

I am saddened when I remember that day, when they arrived,  
They came to devastate this country with hunger and death,  
You are guilty, they said, then they were content with those who died,  
It is surprising to hear it because with the words that came from their mouths, they wounded, they killed.

Land, land adored by our ancestors.  
Your children (yours), before the devastators arrived, were happy, they laughed, they sang,  
Who must have been those who came long ago, came and came to harm you,  
Surely they ate, they slept, then they trampled your face as they walked.

Sadness and tears preceded death,  
Followed by your brothers who are famine, faintness, burial.  
You have no salvation. I cry, I suffocate, my soul aches when I see your wound,  
Well hidden, distorted, twisted truth of the confrontation that took place.

Listen, dust and ashes of our first ancestors,  
Faulty reasonings were made, all your children (yours) fought,  
Slowly they were transformed, they walked, they worked, they hungered, they died,  
The annihilation of our ancestors was swift, endowed with much wisdom because they were burned,

Nothing has changed today, beloved land, you suffer,  
In the past, those who died were those who gave you breath so that the beat of your soul could still be heard,  
People, my beloved people, may those who came long ago change their reasoning, because you are not just a country,

YOU ARE MY LAND

KEMCHI’Grammar

In K’iche’ the completive aspect indicates that the action has been completed relative to the time in which it is being spoken. Remember that aspect gives us a text internal perspective of time, how events relate to each other: the completive aspect marks events that have been completed relative to other events. We generally translate the completive with the past in English (I went, I ate, etc.).

The completive marker is the prefix **x-** , which replaces the incompletive **k(a)-**. In the completive, there is no filler vowel –a- in the third person singular linking the aspect marker with the verb stem, like in the incompletive aspect. See the following examples:

1.Katb’ek.  
K-at-b’ek  
INC-2sing- go  
You go. | 1.Xatb’ek.  
x-at-b’ek  
COMP-2sing-go  
You went.

2.Kab’ek.  
Ka-Ø-b’ek.  
INC-3sing- go  
He/she/it goes. |  2.Xb’ek  
x-Ø-b’ek  
COMP-3sing-go  
He/she/it went.  
3.Ximb’ek.  
x-im-b’ek.  
COMP-1sing-go  
I went. | 4.Ximb’e ruk’ le ajkun iwir.  
x-im-b’e r-uk’ le ajkun iwir  
COMP-1sing 3sing-with art. doctor yesterday.  
I went to the doctor’s yesterday.  
4.La xtzalij la iwir?  
La x-tzalij la iwir?  
INT COMP-return 2sing.form yesterday  
Did you return yesterday? |  5.Je’, xintzalijik.  
Je’, x-in-tzalij-ik.  
Yes, COMP-1sing-return-pfm.  
Yes, I returned.  
  
The pronouns and phrase final markers are the same as for incompletive verbs.

Introduction

In this lesson you will various words used to ask questions. These words are known as interrogative pronouns and are similar to the wh- question words in English (what, when, which, whom, how). Unlike English, K’iche’ does not need an auxiliary verb “do” to form wh- questions.

In this lesson, we are reminded not to try to make one-to-one correspondences between K’iche’ phrases and their corresponding English translations. Some of the phrases below are idiomatic constructions that have developed over time and have nuanced meanings and uses.

# Tïjonïk 15: Kinusik'ij le nunan (My mother calls me) – Transitive Verbs

![](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/Chirij-Raxon-Nahuala-2-825x510.jpg)

Introducción

En la lección 10 discutimos los verbos intransitivos. En esta lección estudiaremos los verbos transitivos, que son diferentes ya que no sólo tienen marcador de sujeto sino también de objeto.

TZIJONIKTexto

En este video, al Mari’y nos habla de lo que hace en un día normal. ¿Puede distinguir la diferencia entre los verbos intransitivos y los verbos transitivos que usa?

KEMCHI’Gramática

La morfología de los verbos transitivos en k’iche’ es diferente de la de los verbos en español o inglés. Al igual que en español e inglés, los verbos transitivos se marcan con el sujeto o agente. Sin embargo, en k’iche’ también se marcan con el objeto. Esto significa que los verbos transitivos en k’iche’ tienen morfemas que se refieren tanto al sujeto como el objeto. Los lingüistas se refieren a los primeros como marcadores ergativos (**juego A**) y a los últimos marcadores absolutivos (**juego B**). Los siguientes son ejemplos de verbos que comienzan con consonante. Más tarde veremos los verbos que comienzan con vocal.

Ex. 1  
Kinusik’ij le nunan.  
K-in-u-sik’ij le nu-nan  
K – in – u – sik’ij le nu – nan  
Inc – 1sB – 3sA- llamar art. 1sPos – mamá  
Mi mamá me llama.

Abreviaciones: Inc = Aspecto incompletivo; 1sB Primera persona singular, juego B; 3sA = Tercera persona singular, juego A; 1sPos = Primera persona singular, posesivo

En el ejemplo 1, el marcador absolutivo (**Juego B**) /-in-/ se refiere al objeto «me»(yo) y el marcador ergativo **(Juego A)** /-u-/ al sujeto «ella.» Nótese que ambos, el sujeto y el objeto, se marcan en el verbo. A los marcadores ergativos se les llama «juego A» y a los absolutivos «juego B.» El prefijo /k-/ es el marcador incompletivo, como ya sabemos. Y la raíz verbal es /sik’ij/.

Ej. 2  
Xixqach’ab’ej iwir.  
X-ix-qa-ch’ab’ej iwir.  
X – ix – qa – ch’ab’ej iwir  
Comp. – 2pB – 1pA – hablar ayer  
Nosotros les hablamos a ustedes ayer.

Abreviaciones: Comp. = Aspecto completivo; 2pB = Segunda persona plural, Juego B; 1pA = Primera persona plural, Juego A.

En el Ej. 2 el prefijo /x-/ es el marcador de aspecto completivo; /-ix-/ marca el objeto, la segunda persona plural «ustedes»; /-qa-/ marca el sujeto, primera persona plural «nosotros» y /-ch’ab’ej/ es la raíz verbal.

En la siguiente tabla vemos un resumen preliminar de la morfología de los verbos transtivos:

Tiempo/Aspecto | Objeto (Juego B) | Sujeto (Juego A) | Raíz  
---|---|---|---  
k(a) – (incompletivo) | -in- (1era persona sing.) | -in- (1era persona sing.) | -sik’ij (llamar) Ej. 1  
-at- (2da persona sing.) | -a- (2da persona sing.)  
x- (completivo) | -Ø- (3ra persona sing.) | -u- (3ra persona sing.)  
-oj- (1era persona pl.) | -qa- (1era persona pl.) |  -ch’ab’ej(hablar) Ej. 2  
Nota: La vocal /a/ en ka- desaparece cuando el pronombre de objeto comienza con vocal | -ix- (2da persona plural) | -i- (2da persona plural)  
-e- (3ra persona plural) | -ki- (3ra persona plural)  
  
**Tipos de verbos transitivos**

El k’iche’ tiene dos tipos de verbos transitivos según su morfología:

1) **Transitivos radicales****:** La raíz verbal tiene la forma CVC (C= consonante; V= vocal). En posición final se les añade un marcador de final de frase: /-u/ si la vocal de la raíz verbal es /u/ y /-o/ en los demás casos.

Ex. 3  
La xaloq’ jun alej?  
la x-Ø-a-loq’ jun a-lej  
la x – Ø – a -loq’ jun a – lej  
Int. Comp.-3sB-2sA- comprar una 2sPos-tortilla  
¿Compraste una (tu) tortilla?

Abreviaciones: Int = Partícula de interrogación; Comp. = Aspecto completivo; 3sB = Tercera persona singular, Juego B; 2sA = Segunda persona singular, Juego A; 2sPos = Segunda persona singular, Posesivo.

Je’, xinloq’o.  
je’ x-Ø-in-loq’-o  
je’ x – Ø – in- loq’ – o  
sí Comp.- 3sB -1sA- comprar – MFF  
Sí, la compré.

Abreviaciones: Comp. = Aspecto completivo; 3sB = Tercera persona singular; 1sA = Primera persona singular, Juego A; MFF = Marcador de final de frase.

En el Ej.3, cuando el verbo aparece al final de la frase, se usa el marcador de final de frase/-o/, que es la misma vocal de raíz de /loq’/ “comprar.”

Ej. 4  
La xib’an le ichak?  
La x-Ø-i-b’an le i-chak?  
La – x – Ø – i – b’an le i – chak.  
Int. – Comp. – 3sB – 2pA – hacer art. 2pPos – trabajo.  
¿Hicieron (uds.) su trabajo?

Je’ xqab’ano.  
Je’ x-qa-b’an-o.  
Sí x – Ø – qa – b’an – o.  
Sí Comp – 3sB – 1sA – hacer – FF.  
Sí, lo hicimos.  

Na xqab’an taj.   
Na x-Ø-qa-b’an taj.  
Na x – Ø – qa – b’an taj.  
Neg1 x – 3sB – 1pA – hacer Neg2.  
No, no lo hicimos.   

Nótese, en el ejemplo 4, que el verbo lleva un marcador de final de frase cuando es la última palabra de la frase, en este caso /-o/. Nótese además que porque «chak» trabajo es tercera persona del singular, el marcador Ø (cero) ocupa el lugar del objeto. 

2) **Transitivos Derivados****:** Tienen el sufijo /-Vj/ (V = vocal) después de la raíz y no llevan marcadores de final de frase.

Ex. 5  
La xinutzukuj le tijoxel?  
La x-in-u-tzukuj le tijoxel?  
La x – in – u – tzukuj le tijoxel?  
Int. Comp. – 1sB – 3sA -buscar art. estudiante?  
¿Me buscó el estudiante?

Je’, xatutzukuj.  
Je’, x-at-u-tzukuj.  
Je’ x – at – u – tzukuj.  
Sí, comp. – 2sB – 3sA- buscar.  
Sí, te buscó.  

Na xatutzukuj taj.  
Na x-at-u-tzukuj taj.  
Na x – at – u – tzukuj taj.  
Neg 1. Comp. – 2sB – 3sA – buscar Neg 2.  
No te buscó.

En el Ej. 5 el transitivo derivado /tzukuj/ “buscar” no lleva marcador de frase final, a diferencia de /-loq'(o)/ en el Ej. 4.

**Objeto de tercera persona plural:** Cuando el marcador de objeto de la tercera persona plural /-e/ se da junto con el marcador de sujeto de la primera persona /-in/, se borra la [i] y se añade la [-e] a la [n].

Ej. 5  
Kench’ab’ej le ak’alab’.  
k-e-in-ch’ab’ej le ak’alab’  
k – e – in – ch’ab’ej le ak’alab’  
Inc.-3pB-1sA – hablar art. children.  
Hablo a los niños.

**Verbos que comienzan con vocal.** Para los verbos que empiezan con vocal, se utilizan otros marcadores de juego A:****

Ex. 6  
Na xinwil ta le me’s pa ja.  
na x-Ø-inw-il ta le me’s pa ja.  
Na x – Ø – inw- il ta le me’s pa ja  
Neg1 comp. – 3sB – 1sA – ver Neg2 art. gato loc. casa  
No vi el gato en la casa.

En el Ej. 6, en vez de /-in/ el marcador de primera persona es /-inw/.

Ex. 7  
Xatriye’j le a Tun pa le b’e.  
x-at-r-iye’j le a Tun pa le b’e.  
x – at – r -iye’j le a Tun pa le b’e  
Comp.- 2sB – 3sA -esperar art. Antonio loc. art. camino  
Antonio te esperó en el camino.

In Ej. 7, en vez de /-u/, el marcador de tercera persona singular es /-r/.

Aspecto | Objeto(Juego B) | Sujeto (Juego A) | Raíz  
---|---|---|---  
k(a) – (incompletivo) | -in- (1ra persona sing) | -inw- (1ra persona singular) | -il(o) (ver) Ej. 6  
-at- (2da persona sing) | -aw- (2da persona singular)  
x- (completivo) | -Ø- (3ra persona sing) | -r- (3ra persona singular)  
-oj- (1ra persona plural) | -q- (1ra persona plural) |  -iye’j (esperar) Ej. 7  
Note: La vocal  
/a/ en ka- desaparece cuando el pronombre de objeto comienza con vocal | -ix- (2da persona plural) | -iw- (2da persona plural)  
-e- (3ra persona plural) | -i- (3ra persona plural)  
  
**Formas reverenciales:** En las construcciones reverenciales o formales, como hemos visto con los verbos intransitivos, se añaden las partículas  _la_ (singular) o  _alaq_ (plural) _después_ del verbo.

Ex. 8  
Xinsik’ij la  
x-in-Ø-sik’ij la  
x – in – Ø – sik’ij la  
Comp.-1sB-Ø-llamar 2sA(F)  
Usted me llamó (formal).

Abreviación: 2sA(F) = Segunda persona singular, Set A formal.

En el Ej. 8 la partícula _la_ denota tanto el sujeto como respeto hacia él/ella. Nótese que un morfema cero Ø reemplaza el marcador de Juego A en el verbo, ya que en construcciones formales el marcador va _después_ del verbo.

Ex. 9  

Xinsik’ij alaq  
x-in-Ø-sik’ij alaq  
x – in – Ø – sik’ij alaq  
Comp.-1sB-Ø-llamar 2pA(F)  
Ustedes me llamaron (formal).

Abreviación: 2sA(F) = Segunda persona plural, Set A (formal).

En el Ej. 9 un cero aparece en la posición del marcador de sujeto, y la partícula _alaq_ sigue al verbo.

Ex. 1Ø  
Xesik’ij la  
x – e – Ø – sik’ij la  
Comp.- 3pB – Ø – llamar 2sA(F)   
Usted (formal) los llamó.

De la misma manera, en el Ej. 10 al sujeto lo denota la partícula _la_ , mientras que /-e/ es el marcador de objeto de la tercera persona plural.

Nota: Cuando el oyente también es el objeto verbal, las formas reverenciales no se pueden construír en voz activa. Se necesita utilizar una forma pasiva o antipasiva, las cuales estudiaremos más adelante.

Ex. 11  
Kakitzukuj alaq (*)  
Ka-ki-tzukuj alaq  
Inc.-Ø-3sA-buscar 2pA(F)  
Ellos los buscan (a ustedes) (formal).

Ej. 11 NO ES gramaticalmente posible en k’iche’. Para formular esta frase, se necesita una construcción pasiva o antipasiva, las cuales estudiaremos más adelante.

El alcalde

En Nahualá, mi pueblo, el alcalde es muy importante porque es el hombre o mujer que debe vigilar y servir al pueblo. Hoy en día, hay muchos hombres que quieren ser alcalde. Hay muchos grupos políticos que se organizan. Escogen a una mujer o un hombre respetado para que participe en las elecciones del alcalde en nuestro pueblo. Es necesario que usemos (nuestra) razón: hay más grupos que solo quieren que su persona entre al gobierno que los que quieren ayudar a nuestra gente. Un cambio es necesario. Por eso estamos usando nuestro conocimiento para cambiar lentamente nuestro pueblo. Estamos trabajando por el futuro de nuestros hijos. Es necesario que miremos hacia adelante para que nuestros hijos puedan aprender sobre la realidad y necesidades de las diferentes comunidades en nuestro pueblo. Recordemos que hay muchos que quieren entrar al gobierno, pero es necesario que veamos si este hombre o mujer puede velar por nosotros equitativamente cuando sea elegido, porque todos tenemos derecho al bienestar, a ser felices.

KEMCHI’Gramática

A continuación veremos el uso de construcciones comunes que utilizan verbos auxiliares (en español los verbos auxiliares suelen ir seguidos del infinitivo, como en **quiero _llorar_**). En k’iche’, después de verbos auxiliares, se utiliza otro verbo completo.

**Kowinik** “poder”: El verbo principal viene después de una forma de «kowinik,» con el cual concuerda en persona y aspecto.

Kinkowinik kimb’ek.  
K-in-kowin-ik k-im-b’e-k  
INC-1sing-poder-mff INC-1sing-ir-mff.  
Puedo ir.

Xatkowinik xab’ano.  
x-at-kowin-ik x-a-b’an-o  
COMP-2sing-poder-mff COMP-2sing-hacer-mff.

Kinkowinik kink’am b’i le pwaq we karaj le nutat  
k-in-kowinik k-in-k’am b’i le pwaq we ka-r-aj le nu-tat  
INC-1sing-poder INC-1sing-llevar direccional art. dinero si INC-3sing-querer art. mi-padre  
Puedo llevar el dinero si mi padre quiere.

La kakowin alaq kinto’ alaq?  
La ka-Ø-kowin alaq k-in-Ø-to’ alaq?  
INT INC-Ø-poder 2pl(formal) INC-1sing-Ø-ayudar?  
¿Pueden ustedes (formal) ayudarme?

**Aj** “querer” (vtr): En construcciones que utilizan el verbo aj «querer,» no es necesario que el verbo principal concuerde en persona con el verbo -aj.

Kawaj  
ka-w-aj  
Yo (lo) quiero | Kaqaj  
Ka-q-aj

---|---

COMP-2sing-querer COMP-2sing-hacer-mff  
Querías hacer(lo)./Quisiste hacer(lo).

La kaj la kujtzalij la aninaq?  
La k-Ø-aj la k-uj-tzalij la aninaq?  
INT INC-Ø-querer 2sing,formal INC-1pl-regresar dir. rápido  
¿Quiere usted (formal) que (nosotros) regresemos aquí rápido?

La kaj la koje’xojowa chwe’q?  
La k-Ø-aj la k-oj-e’-xojow-a chwe’q?  
INT INC-Ø-querer 2sing,form. INC-1pl-movimiento incorporado-bailar-MFF mañana  
Do you (formal) want us to go dance tomorrow?

**Rajawaxik** “es necesario”, “necesitar”: La raíz irregular pasiva (ajawaxik) del verbo aj «querer» es la base de la frase **rajawaxik** “es necesario.” El sujeto y el tipo de necesidad se expresa en el verbo que le sigue. “Rajawaxik” también puede utilizarse como sustantivo: algo necesario.

Rajawaxik katzijon le nan ruk’ le tat.  
Es necesario que la madre hable con el padre.

Rajawaxik kaya’ kan le pwaq wuk’ in.  
Es necesario dejar el dinero conmigo.

Rajawaxik kaya’ kan le qawa rumal le aj ik’.

Jas rajawaxik kab’anik?  
¿Qué es necesario que se haga?

Chab’ij chwe we k’o jun arajawaxik.  
Decime si tenés una necesidad (si necesitas algo).

**Tajin :** describe una acción continua o un evento que se lleva a cabo al mismo tiempo que otro («progresivo» en español: estoy/estaba hablando). En k’iche’ esta idea se expresa con la palabra  _katajin(ik_), la cual es seguida por un verbo transitivo o intransitivo en el aspecto incompletivo(con la persona correspondiente). En habla coloquial, _katajin_ a menudo se acorta y se convierte en  _tajin._

**Acciones progresivas en el _incompletivo:_  
**_katajin_ \+ verbo en incompletivo:  

Katajin ku’l le winaq chanim.  
La gente está llegando ahora.

**Acciónes progresivas en el _completivo_ :  
**_katajin_ \+ verbo en incompletivo; el contexto indica que la acción se dio en el pasado:  

Katajin kajosq’ix le ulew aretaq xinopan chi la’.  
La tierra estaba siendo limpiada cuando llegué allí.

**Progresivo en tiempo futuro:  
**_katajin_ \+ verb; el contexto indica que la acción se dará en el futuro:  

Katajin kewa’ le winaq aretaq kujok pa ja.  
La gente estára comiendo cuando entremos a la casa.

Ejemplos adicionales:

Katajin kujwa’ik.  
Estamos comiendo.

Katajin kixukunaj le itat.  
Su padre los está curando (a ustedes).

Katajin kinkunax waral.  
Estoy siendo curado aquí.

Katajin kekunataj le e yawab’ib’.

# Tïjonïk 17: In k'o pa uk'u'x tinamit (I am at the center of town) – Prepositions

![](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/imperatives_19_feature-image-825x510.jpg)

![Print Friendly](//cdn.printfriendly.com/button-print-gry20.png)

Introducción

El k’iche’ tiene dos tipos de preposiciones: **simples y complejas.** Las preposiciones simples corresponden a palabras sueltas en español como, _a, sobre, en,_ etc. Las complejas consisten de varios elementos, usualmente una preposición simple seguida de un sustantivo poseído. Utilizamos estas frases complejas para referirnos a relaciones de espacio (_a la par de, en frente de,_ etc.).

TZIJONIKTexto

Nuestro ajtij, Xwan, describe el centro de Nahualá:

KEMCHI’Gramática

**PREPOSICIONES SIMPLES**

**PA  
****Pa** marca el lugar donde algo sucede, o donde está posicionado. Puede traducirse de varias maneras al español. Veamos:

  1. K’o jun xa’r pa ja.  
Hay un vaso  _en_ la casa.

  2. Xekos le ixoqib’ pa le b’e.  
Las mujeres se cansaron  _en_ el camino.

Cuando se combina con verbos de movimiento (ir, venir, llegar), **pa** introduce la locación, mientras que la trayectoria del verbo se indica en la semántica del verbo:

  3. Kape le a Wel pa Nawalja’.  
a. Manuel viene _de_ Nahualá. (=él es de Nahualá)  
b. Manuel viene  _a_ Nahualá.

  4. Kintzalij pa le nutinamit.  
Regreso _a_ mi pueblo.

  5. Kul le al We’l pa Nashville chaq’ab’.  
Manuela llega (aquí) _a_ Nashville en la noche.

  6. Ke’l le e winaq pa le tyox.  
La gente sale _de_ la iglesia.

**CHI**

**Chi** significa _en_ o  _hacia_ pero es, mayoritariamente utilizado como parte de toponimios (nombres de lugares):

  7. Pa le jun wokaj ub’i’ Chi Masat kape wi le achi.  
lit: De un caserío de nombre Chi Masat viene el hombre.  
El hombre viene _de_ un caserío que se llama Chi Masat (Lugar de venados)

  8. Chi kaj  
lit.: En el cielo  
Encima, arriba

**Nota: Chi** también es una conjunción que introduce cláusulas complementarias de objetos de verbos transitivos (Ej: Veo **que** hiciste esto). También es parte de preposiciones complejas como veremos abajo. Tenga cuidado de no confundir la preposición **chi** con el adverbio **chi(k)** «otra vez»; «ya» o el locativo demostrativo **chi’ «** aquí.»

La preposición compleja Ch(i) + E+ chi’ “a lo largo de; al borde de», (véase abajo) a veces se acorta y se transforma en **chi**.

  9. E k’i le taq che’ tikil chi le b’e.  
Hay muchos árboles plantados al borde del camino.

Favor también notar que **chi** a veces también es usado para denotar «con.»

  10. Xkamisax **chi** ch’ich’  
Fue muerto/a **con** machete.**PREPOSICIONES COMPLEJAS**

El k’iche’ tiene una variedad de preposiciones complejas que están compuestas de tres elementos:

**pa** o **chi** \+ **pronombre posesivo****(E)** \+ **sustantivo (relacional)  
**Pa + qa +wi’  
en nuestra cima (lit.: pelo, cabello)

Los sustantivos relacionales son, a menudo, partes del cuerpo con marcadores de posesión (consulte la lección 40 para obtener más información sobre las partes del cuerpo). Siempre ocurren con marcadores de posesión y su función es relacionar dos argumentos en una frase en términos de relaciones de pertenencia, causa, reflexividad, temporalidad, o espacio (la lección 20 tratará este tema con más detalle).

A veces, la **i** de **chi,** o la **a** de **pa** se omiten:

chi+ nu+wach chinuwach  
_frente a mí_ (no se juntan vocales, no se omite la **i**)

chi+u+wach chuwach  
_frente a él/ella_ (se juntan vocales, se omite la **i**)

pa+qa+wi’  
paqawi’  
_sobre nosotros_ (no se juntan vocales, no se omite la **a**)

pa+a+wi’  
pawi’  
_sobre vos_ (se juntan vocales, se omite la **a**)

Cuando utilizamos pronombres posesivos honoríficos o de registro formal, éstos siguen el sustantivo relacional:

chi wach la  
_frente a usted_ (sg, formal)

chi xo’l alaq  
_entre ustedes_ (pl, formal)

**-WACH  
**Chi + E + wach  
Esta es una de las preposiciones más utilizadas. Significa _en frente de, ante._

*En la tercera persona del singular (chuwach), muy a menudo se utilizan contracciones de manera:

Chuwach en frente de él/ella  
Chwach en frente de él/ella  
Chuwa en frente de él/ella  
Cho en frente de él/ella 

  11. Le ro’ch le a Te’k k’o chwach le uk’ay le nunan.  
La casa de diego está _frente a_ la venta de mi madre.

  12. Xink’ut le elaq’om chiwach.  
Les mostré el ladrón. (Lit.: Les mostré el ladron frente a ustedes/a sus caras).
  13. Xuk’ut le K’iche’ ch’ab’al le al Nela chqawach.  
Nela nos enseñó el idioma k’iche’. (Lit.: Nela enseñó el idioma k’iche frente a nosotros/a nuestras caras).

*Algunos verbos requieren una indicación de cómo el evento actúa sobre su referente. En estos casos **chuwach** se refiere a _la superficie de algo,_ pero no siempre puede traducirse al español.

  14. Xatxuli’ chuwach le juyub’.  
Bajaste (la superficie de) la montaña.

*Los acortamientos **chuwach** (**chuwa/chwa/cho**) se utilizan en combinación con la palabra **ja**(_casa_) para denotar, _casa_ o _patio_.

  15. Xb’e le achi **chwa** ro’ch.  
El hombre se fue a casa.

  16. K’o **chwa** ro’ch le pare.  
(Él/ella) está en la casa del sacerdote.

  17. K’o **cho** ja.  
(Él/ella) está en casa.

Recuerda que **chi + E + wach** también se utilizan frases con sentido **comparativo**. Las frases comparativas generalmente se pueden reconocer por un elemento enfocado (**are** para tercera persona) seguido de una forma de **chi + E + wach** como expresión que introduce la comparación (véase lección sobre adjetivos).

**-ECH  
**chi + E + ech  
Esta **preposición compleja** presenta el beneficiario de un evento. En español puede traducirse como _a; para._ La mayoría de hablantes utilizan una forma abreviada (indicado en negrita), pero también se escucha la forma completa.

**

chwe**(ch)  
a mí/para mí

**

****chawe**(ch)  
a vos/para vos

**

****che**(ch) **la  
**a usted/para usted (formal)

**

****che**(ch)  
a él,ella/para él,ella

**

****chqe**(ch)  
a nosotros/para nosotros

**

****chiwe**(ch)  
a ustedes/para ustedes

**

****che**(ch) **alaq  
**a ustedes/para ustedes (formal, pl.)

**

****chke**(ch)  
a ellos, ellas/para ellos, ellas

  18. Xaya’ jun awuj **chwech**  
Me diste un tu libro/ Me diste un libro tuyo. (lit.: diste un tu libro **a mí**)
  19. Maltyox **chawe  
**Gracias (a vos)
  20. Maltyox **chech la  
**Gracias (a usted)

La tercera persona sg. **che** se utiliza para introducir “construcciones infinitivas” que incluyen sustantivos verbales pasivos (ver la lección posterior sobre pasivos).

**-XE’  
**chi +E+ –xe’  
Esta preposición significa (_de)bajo, al pie de_ (ver ejemplo 22):

  20. K’o jun chikop chuxe’ le tz’alam.  
Hay un animal debajo de la tabla.

  21. Kinxuli’ chuxe’ le juyub’.  
Bajo al pie de la montaña.

  22. Xekanaj kan chuxe’ le ul.  
Se quedaron debajo del derrumbe.

También, temporalmente, indica _antes de_.

  23. Kink’uli’ chuxe’ unimaq’ij le qanan Talin.  
Me casaré antes de la fiesta de Santa Catarina (Patrona de Nahualá).

  24. Chuxe’ le qachomal kaqatij wi jun qameq’in.  
Antes de la (nuestra)reunión nos tomamos una bebida caliente (café, atol).****

**-WI’  
**chi + E + wi’  
Esta preposición aparece en conjunto con **pa** y **chi.** Significa _encima_ o  _sobre_.__ Cuando wi’ y chi’ forman parte de preposiciones complejas, se suele omitir la glotal cuando no está en posición final de frase.

  25. Xintik’ib’a le q’eb’al chuwi le wanke’t.  
Puse la jarra sobre la mesa.

  26. Xeqil le chikop puwi le ja.  
Vimos a los animales encima de la casa.

  27. Le alkalte’ k’o paqawi oj, le oj ajch’amiyab’.  
El alcalde está por encima de nosotros, los auxiliares.

–**IJ  
**chi + E + ij  
Cuando se combina con **_chi,_**_–_ _ij_ quiere decir  _atrás_ como expresión locativa,  _sobre/a cerca de_ cuando se habla de un ‘tema’, o _después_ al hablar de tiempo.

  28. Ke’tz’an le ak’alab’ chiqij.  
Los niños juegan atras de nosotros.

Hay un perrito entre los pollitos.
  33. Q’alaj le tyox chuxo’l taq le ja.

**-TZALAJ

Los hombres caminan al lado de las mujeres.

Introducción

En esta unidad, aprenderemos a dar órdenes y mandatos en k’iche’. Empezaremos explicando con la morfología del imperativo, la forma verbal que se utiliza con órdenes y los mandatos.

TZIJONIKTexto

Alida y Charlotte, dos estudiantes de k’iche’ de los Estados Unidos, practican vocabulario y los mandatos con Silveria, su maestra.

KEMCHI’Gramática

Los imperativos se marcan con un **prefijo** llamado **marcador TAM** (marcador de tiempo, aspecto y modo) y con sufijos específicos. Estos prefijos y sufijos varían entre verbos intransitivos y transitivos.

El marcador TAM que se usa principalmente en la forma imperativa es **ch-**. Éste se añade en el espacio del TAM en el verbo. El prefijo incompletivo **k-** también puede utilizarse, y comunica un mandato más fuerte. El marcador **ch-** tiene varios usos en k’iche’. También se utiliza como un tipo de subjuntivo, también llamado aspecto relativo (Mondloch) o modo dependiente.

En k’iche’, el destinatario se marca en todos los verbos imperativos. Al igual que en los verbos activos normales, con los imperativos intransitivos se utiliza el Juego B de pronombres y con los imperativos transitivos se utiliza el Juego A y el Juego B para indicar el sujeto/agente y el objeto del verbo. Estas formas imperativas/exhortativas también pueden derivarse de otras raízes verbales intransitivas como formas pasivas o antipasivas (más adelante tendremos una unidad que trata estas formas).

**Verbos intransitivos  
**La forma imperativa/exhortativa del verbo se marca con el prefijo **k-/ch-** y con el sufijo **-a** en mitad de frase, o el sufijo **-oq** en posición final.

Los imperativos intransitivos en mitad de frase no tienen el acento en la última sílaba, más bien en la antepenúltima, que usualmente es parte de la raíz verbal.

Prefijo TAM: **ch-/k-  
**Sufijo: **-a/-oq** (posición final)

  1. Katwaroq!  
¡Dormí (vos)!
  2. Chinuxlanoq  
¡Que yo descanse!
  3. Chixwara cho ja! ¡Duerman en casa!

Los verbos «entrar» «venir» e «ir» son irregulares en sus formas imperativas, como podemos ver abajo:

  4. ok – entrar (raíz verbal)

Katojo’!  
¡Entrá!

Kixojo’!  
¡Entren!

Sa’j la!  
¡Entre! (formal, usted)

Sa’j alaq!  
¡Entren! (formal, pl)

  5. pe(t) – venir (raíz verbal)

Chatpetoq!  
¡Vení!

Chixpetoq!  
¡Vengan! (ustedes, informal)

Chixpeta waral!  
¡Vengan aquí! (ustedes, informal)

Peta la!  
¡Venga! (usted, formal)

Peta alaq!  
¡Vengan! (ustedes, formal)

Peta la jewa’!  
¡Venga acá! (formal)

  6. b’e(k) – ir (raíz verbal)

Jo!  
¡Vamos!

Jat!  
¡Andá! ¡Ve!

Jat jela’!  
¡Andate (allá)!

Jix!  
¡Vayan!

Oj la jela’!  
¡Vaya! (usted)

**Verbos transitivos**

Hay dos tipos de imperativos transitivos:

Verbos derivados (no CVC)  
El imperativo/exhortativo de verbos derivados/no CVC se marca con los prefios **k-** or **ch** -. No existen marcadores o sufijos en posición final.

Prefijo TAM: **ch-/k-  
**Sufijo: **no hay**

  7. Chatijoj!  
¡Enseñá(le)! (a él o ella)

  8. Chkitijoj!  
¡Que (ellos/as) le enseñen! (a él o ella)

  9. Chinkitijoj!  
¡Que me enseñen! (ellos/as a mí)

  10. Chawesaj le apowi’!  
¡Quitate el sombrero!

CVC/ verbos radicales transitivos  
El imperativo se los verbos radicales se marca con los prefijos **k-** o **ch-** y con el sufijo **–V** (vocal) seguido de glotal.

Prefijo TAM: **ch-/k-  
**Sufijo:  
CoC (vocal de raíz o) **–o(’)  
**CuC (vocal de raíz u) **–u(’)  
**Ca/e/iC (el resto de vocales de raíz -a,e,i) **–a(’)**

Glotal en posición final  
En las formas exhortativas se requiere una glotal en posición final cuando el verbo termina la frase o cuando el verbo es seguido por una vocal diferente a la vocal del marcador final.

  11. Chaloq’o’!  
¡Compralo!
  12. Chab’ana’!  
¡Hacelo!
  13. Loq’o’ alaq!  
¡Cómprenlo! (ustedes, formal)

Si el verbo no está en posición final, o si la vocal que le sigue es la misma que la del marcador final, se omite la glotal y se alarga la vocal final.

  14. Loq’o la!  
¡Cómprelo! (usted)
  15. B’ana la!  
¡Hágalo! (usted)
  16. B’ana alaq!  
¡Háganlo! (formal)

También se puede formar imperativos con verbos reflexivos (los reflexivos se tratan con más detalle en la lección 24):

  17. Chichajij iwib’!  
¡Cuídense! (informal)

**Excepciones** :  
A. El prefijo **ch-** no aparece cuando el agente es primera persona plural y el objeto tercera persona singular:

  18. Qabana’!  
¡Hagámoslo!
  19. Qatijoj!  
¡Enseñémoslo!

B. En la forma reverencial (formal) del imperativo (la/alaq), se utiliza el pronombre de objeto de la 3ra persona singular (Ø). A veces se omite el marcador TAM ch-/k- para evitar conglomeración de consonantes:

* indica forma no gramatical

  20. *Chwara la
  21. Wara la!  
¡Duerma! (usted)

  21. *Chtijoj la!
  22. Tijoj la!  
¡Enseñe! (usted)

Cuando la letra que sigue el marcador ch- es vocal, no hay conglomeración de consonantes y el marcador ch- se retiene:

  22. Chesaj la!  
¡Saquelo! (usted)

# Tïjonïk 20: Saqirik Iwonojel! (Good morning, everyone!) – Relational Nouns

Introducción

Los sustantivos relacionales desempeñan el mismo papel sintáctico que las preposiciones en español, pero se flexionan como sustantivos. En contraste a las preposiciones locativas **chi** y **pa** , los sustantivos relacionales siempre son poseídos. Denotan una relación de pertenencia, causalidad, reflexividad, temporalidad o espacialidad entre dos frases.

TZIJONIKTexto

En la unidad 10, leímos un texto escrito por Maricio, un estudiante principiante de k’iche’ que hablaba de su rutina diaria. Mauricio luego fue a Nahualá a estudiar k’iche’ y escribió el texto a continuación. Léalo y luego estudie las explicaciones de los sustantivos relacionales. Ya hemos estado utilizando varios de ellos en lecciones previas. Después de leer la sección _kemchi’,_ vuelva al texto e identifíquelos.

Chanim, pa Nahualja’ in k’o wi. Sib’alaj utz kinwil le tinamit. K’o le nima k’ayb’al pa jueves choqe’ pa domingo. E k’i le winaq keb’e che loq’omanik pa k’ayb’al. K’i le jastaq kak’ayix rumal le ajk’ay: k’o le lej, le q’or, le kar, le atz’yaq. Ronojel le jastaq kawaj k’o pa k’ayb’al.

Mostrar/Ocultar traducción español

En este momento estoy en Nahualá. Me gusta mucho el pueblo. Hay un gran mercado los jueves y los domingos. Hay mucha gente que va a hacer sus compras en el mercado. Hay muchas cosas que se venden (por los comerciantes): hay tortillas, atol, pescado, ropa. Todas las cosas que uno quiera se venden en el mercado.

Quiero aprender el idioma k’iche’, por eso vine aquí. Todos los días tengo clase de k’iche’ en la escuela. Es un poco cansado porque camino a la escuela. Pero me gusta porque no camino solo. Mis compañeros caminan conmigo. En la escuela, se leen libros y las palabrs son escritas por el maestro. También nosotros los estudiantes leemos y escribimos. ¡Aprender k’iche’ es mucho trabajo, pero aprendo muchas cosas!

KEMCHI’Gramática

A)**-ECH**

**  
** Este sustantivo indica una relación de **posesión** , **asociación** , o **propósito**. La persona gramatical que lo posee puede enfatizarse al ser seguido por un pronombre del Juego B (pronombre absolutivo). También, puede contraerse, como vemos en los ejemplos abajo:

**

We**(ch) (in) mío

**

Awe**(ch) (at) tuyo

**

Re**(ch) (ri are) suyo

**

**Ech la (lal) de usted

**

Qe**(ch) (oj) nuestro

**

Iwe**(ch) (ix) de ustedes (informal)

**

Ke**(ch) (ri a’re’) de ellos/ellas

**

Ech** alaq (ala) de ustedes (formal)

Posesión

W**ech** in le tz’ib’ab’al.  
El lápiz es mío.  

Ronojel le ulew **ech** alaq.  
Toda esta tierra es de ustedes (formal)

“Asociación”- El poseedor es generalmente no agentivo y no es dueño del objeto sino más bien expresa una asociación cercana entre ellos.

Sib’alaj utz kinwil le atz’yaq r**ech** Nahuala.  
Me gusta mucho la ropa de Nahualá.  

Jawi k’o wi le wuj r**e** le qatijonik?  
¿Dónde está la hoja de/sobre/a cerca de nuestra lección?

Propósito/beneficiario (dativo)

Kub’an le wa rech le nuk’ulanem.  
Él/ella hace la comida para mi boda.

Construcciones en las que (ch)–ech expresa el destinatario/objeto indirecto:  

Xloq’ ulew chiwech ix.  
La tierra se compró para ustedes (informal).  

Maltyox chiwe.  
Gracias (a ustedes).  

Jas kub’ij chwe?  
¿Qué me está diciendo?/¿Qué me dice? (él/ella)  

Kuya’ le wuj chqe.  
Él/ella nos da el libro.

Otras funciones

**(Ch)-ech** también presenta objetos de manera oblicua después de verbos antipasivos.

En combinación con **rumal** después de verbos intransitivos y formas pasivas, introduce causas indirectas:

Xopan le wuj awuk’ rumal wech in.  
El libro vino contigo por causa mía.

Después de un nominal, **-ech** indica una cualidad o estado de la persona correspondiente:  

Utz awe la’!  
¡Dichoso tú! ¡Bien por ti!

Nota: La forma contraída _e_ significa novio/novia.  

La k’o awe?  
¿Tienes novio/novia?

B) –**UK’  
**Es equivalente a la palabra _con_ , pero también puede indicar locación, como vemos en los últimos dos ejemplos.  

Kinch’aw ruk’ le nunan pa le ch’aweb’al.  
Hablo con mi mamá por teléfono.  

Awuk’ xb’e wi ri ala.  
El muchacho fue con vos.  

Kimb’e ruk’ le ajkun.  
Voy con el doctor. / Voy al doctor.  

Kel b’i ruk’ le ajkun.  
Se va del doctor.

C)**–UMAL**  
El sustantivo –**umal** presenta agentes en construcciones pasivas: _por, a causa de…_  

Xkamsax le me’s rumal le tz’i’.  
El gato fue muerto por el perro.

También presenta causas indirectas, beneficiarios, o instigadores en cláusulas intransitivas.

Xopan le wuj awuk’ rumal wech in.  
El libro vino contigo por causa mía.

Rumal  
Porque

Na kinb’e ta pa le nimatijob’al rumal xinkosik.  
No voy a la escuela porque estoy cansado.

Rumal ri’  
Por eso

Rumal k’u ri’.  
Por ende

Xinkosik, rumal ri’ na ximb’e ta pa le tijob’al.  
Estoy cansado, por eso no fui a la escuela.

D) –**ONOJEL  
**Este sustantivo es un cuantificador. Significa _todos_.

Saqirik iwonojel!  
¡Buenos días (a) todos!  

Ronojel q’ij kinch’aj le nuware.  
Me lavo los dientes todos los días.

E)**-TUKEL**  
-tukel significa _solo._ El referente aparece como marcador posesivo.  

Utukel kakanaj kan pa ja.  
(Él/ella) se queda en casa solo.  

Nutukel kimb’ek.  
Voy solo.

F) **-ij  
**El sustantivo relacional -ij presenta metas verbales. Puede compararse a la palabra en español «tras» en «Se fue tras ella.»

El sustantivo relacional -ij también puede usarse en el sentido de «de» o «sobre,» como en «hablar de algo». Por ejemplo, «xojch’aw chirij ri nuwakatem pa Xela» (hablamos de nuestro viaje a Xela).

En próximas unidades veremos otros sustantivos relacionales.

# Tïjonïk 21: Mattzaqik! (Don't fall!) – Negative Imperatives (Vetatives)

Introduction

We have studied the imperative forms. In this unit we will look at how to form negative imperatives: commands that tell someone to _not_ do something.

TZIJONIKText

There is an expression that is used when seeing someone of the road or when saying goodbye in Nahualá that implements a negative imperative. When someone says “Mattzaqik” (Don’t fall!), they are wishing the person to whom they are speaking that nothing happens to them as they walk. After reading the grammatical description, try to pick out other instances of negative imperatives in the video.

KEMCHI’Grammar

Negative imperatives in K’iche’ are inflected as indicative verbs but take **m(a)-** as aspect marker instead. Negative imperatives, therefore, neither take imperative suffixes **(-a/-oq; -v(‘))** , nor the imperative **ch-** prefix. They do take, however, the same phrase final markers as incompletive transitive/intransitive verbs.

Negative imperatives can also be formed in passive and antipassive constructions, as we will see later on.

1.

Chinq’ab’aroq  
Let me get drunk!

Minq’ab’arik!  
m-in-q’ab’ar-ik  
Let me not get drunk!

2.

Qach’aya’!  
Let us hit him/her/it!

Maqach’ayo!  
ma-ø-qa-ch’ay-o  
Let’s not hit him/her/it!

3.

Chrelaq’aj!  
Let him/her/it steal it!

Marelaq’aj!  
ma-ø-r-elaq’aj  
Let him/her/it not steal it!

4\. Chaloq’o jun tara’s!

Maloq’ le tara’s!

Introducción

Estas palabras funcionan como marcadores de espacio. Establecen un sistema de coordenadas espaciales entre personas y objetos en los que el hablante ocupa el punto de origen. Las primeras (naqaj, naj) denotan distancia relativas desde el hablante: cerca, lejos. Las siguientes tres (waral, chi’, chila’) son expresiones de deixis, es decir, palabras que requieren gestos ostensivos para designar objetos (aquí, allá).

Introducción

Los números en k’iche’ han sido en gran medida reemplazados por números en español. La mayoría de la gente cuenta hasta tres en k’iche’ pero mas allá cuenta en español. Generalmente se entienden los números hasta veinte pero se usan muy poco. El sistema numeral k’iche’ es vigesimal, de base 20.

TZIJONIKTexto

Los números k’iche’s se siguen utilizando hoy en día al contar los días del calendario sagrado (cholq’ij) y durante las ceremonias mayas tradicionales. En este video vemos un ejemplo de las cuentas que se llevan a cabo durante una de estas ceremonias:

KEMCHI’Gramática

En construcciones reflexivas, los verbos transitivos tienen la misma persona gramatical como sujeto y objeto. En k’iche’ se forman con la ayuda del sustantivo relacional –**ib’** (_a sí mismo)_ después del verbo. Con algunas excepciones, **-ib’** concuerda en persona y número con el sujeto verbal.

Construcciones reflexivas requieren un verbo transitivo, que puede ser un pasivo completivo. En formas honoríficas los pronombres **la/alaq** se utilizan solo una vez, después del sustantivo reflexivo (ver ejemplo abajo).

w-ib’ | a mí mismo (me) | q-ib’ | a nosotros mismos (nos)  
---|---|---|---  
aw-ib’ | a ti mismo (te) | iw-ib’ | ustedes mismos (se, informal)  
ib’ la | a usted mismo (se, formal) | ib’ alaq | ustedes (se, formal)  
r-ib’ | a uno mismo(a) (se) | k-ib’ | a ellos/ellas mismas (se)  
  
Un ejemplo de un verbo incompletivo reflexivo:

Kintijoj wib’  
Estudio.

Katijoj awib’  
Estudias.

Kutijoj rib’  
(Él/ella) estudia.

Katijoj ib’ la.  
Usted estudia.

Kaqatijoj qib’.  
Estudiamos.

Kitijoj iwib’.  
Ustedes estudian (informal).

Kakitijoj kib’.  
(Ellos/ellas) Estudian.

Katijoj ib’ alaq.  
Ustedes estudian (formal).

En sus formas plurales, los verbos reflexivos tienen un significado recíproco que significa « _el uno al otro»_

Kaqariq qib’ chwe’q.  
Nos encontramos/juntamos mañana.

Una manera coloquial de despedirse:

Qaqil chi (na) qib’!  
Nos vemos!

El marcador reflexivo -ib’ también ocurre en sustantivos. Si no se posee, no se flexiona con marcadores posesivos.

Ilb’al ib’  
Espejo.

Xinloq’ jun wilb’al wib’.  
Me compré un mi espejo.

K’exb’em ib’  
La diferencia.

Jas le uk’exb’em rib’ le jun ruk’ le jun chik?  
¿Cuál es la diferencia entre este y el otro?

Riqoj ib’  
La reunión/ junta.

K’o jun riqoj ib’.  
Hay una reunión.

K’o jun qariqoj qib’ chwe’q.  
Tenemos una reunión mañana.

Owan ib’  
Escondido (nombre de un juego).

Ke’tz’an le ak’alab’ chech owan ib’  
Los niños juegan escondido.

Xib’in ib’  
Un susto.

Le nimaq’ij rech Halloween jun nimalaj xib’in ib’.  
Halloween es un susto

Tzuqb’al qib’  
Sustento, lo que nos mantiene.

Are le nuchak jun tzuqb’al wib’.

Introduction

Positionals form a word class in K’iche’ defined by meaning and special word structure. They refer to “states” or “positions” of people or objects.

Show/Hide English translation

When a marriage ceremony takes place, the parents and relatives of the young man arrive at the bride’s house, the men sit in chairs and the women sit upon their knees (sepi’) on straw mats. Then the relatives (lit. mothers and fathers) of those who hae arrived at the house give the ceremonial greeting. Once the greeting is given, everyone kneels, a prayer is said, and everyone stands up and sits once again. The bride’s parents invite the couple to sit in their corresponding chairs (they were kneeling before), and the ceremonial speech is given. Once the speech is given, the young man and woman, while kneeling, go around to all present and kiss their hands. Once this is done, it is time to eat. Everyone stands and a short prayer is said. After eating, the bride is dressed with new clothes. Finally, all the relatives kneel and thanks are given. Then they stand, the last greeting is given, and they go back to the young man’s house, now accompanied by his bride. 

KEMCHI’Grammar

Positionals form a word class in K’iche’ defined by meaning and word structure. They refer to “states” or “positions” of people or objects. Usually, they do not appear in root form but require additional suffixes and/or prefixes. Positional roots are of the form CVC (V is short). The following are some examples:

1.

T’uy “sit”

Tak’ “stand”

Q’oy “lie down”

K’ul “marry”

K’as “live”

**Positionals as intransitive verbs**

Positional roots become intransitive verbs when the suffix **–i’(k)** is added (instead of –**ik** for regular intransitive verbs). In non phrase final position, the suffix looses the –**k,** but the glottal stop remains. The intransitive positional verb can be paraphrased as:**to bring oneself into X position or state.**

2.

T’uy “sit”

Kint’uyi’k I sit down

Kint’uyi’ pa tem  
I sit down on the chair.

3.

kot “curved, bent”

Kamul kakoti’ le kumatz chqawach.  
The snake curls twice in front of us.

4.

k’as “live, awake”

Le wija’ xintiko, xk’asi’k.  
My seed that I planted is alive

**Positionals as adjectives/stative verbs**

Positional roots become statives the suffix –**V rl **is added, ( **V** is the root vowel). This stative stem is used is various ways, as outlined below. It can be paraphrased as “**to be in X position/state** ”. These forms take the suffix **–ik** when in phrase-final position.

5.

T’uylik “sit”

T’uyul seated

6.

Tak’alik “stand”

Tak’al standing

7.

Chem “still or dammed water”

Chemel standing water

Please note that the stative verb also (as well as the positional verb) takes phrase-final –**ik**

8.

T’uy “sit”

In t’uyulik. I am seated

In t’uyul puwi le ch’at. I am seated on the bed.

Kint’uyi’k. I am sitting down.

When the positional root ends in –**V’** , only –**l** forms the adjective/stative stem

9.

Q’a’ “lean against something”

Kinq’a’i’k. I am leaning.

Q’a’l Leaning

In q’a’l chirij le tem.  
I am leaning back in the chair.

10.

Q’e’  
Turned lengthwise in an obstructive manner

Kaq’e’i’k  
It is across turned lengthwise.

Q’e’l to be turned lengthwise

Q’e’l le che’ pa le b’e. The tree is lying lengthwise across the road.

Q’e’l le ch’ich’ pa le b’e. The car is turned lengthwise (and is obstructing) the way on the road.

11.

Cho’  
“empty” a container that is not full yet, used mainly for beans and nixtamal (hominy)

Cho’l empty

Cho’l upam le t’u’y the pot has still some space in it

12.

Ku’ “sit”

Ku’l sitting/seated

Xku’i’ le nima q’atb’al tzij  
The president is in office (has been seated).

If the second consonant of the positional CVC root is **–l** or **–r** , the adjective/stative suffix becomes –**Vn** , in which case **V** **does not** necessarily repeat the root vowel.

13.

K’ul to marry

K’ulan married

Janipa chi ix k’ulanik?  
How long have you been married?

14.

Chol “to be in a line”

Cholon “lined up”

E cholon chi le ak’alab’ chwach le tijob’al.  
The children are lined up in front of the school.

15.

Ter “follow”

Teren following

Le tz’i’ teren chirij le rajaw. The dog is following behind its owner.

16.

Kor “loose, not being tied up”

Koron loose

Xkori’ le nupam. “My stomach hangs loose” i.e. my belt is not tight enough.

**Plural forms**

Plural forms require adding the plural pronouns **uj, ix** , **alaq** or **e.**

E t’uyul le i’xoqib’. The women are sitting.

E t’uyulik. They are sitting.

There is another plural positional form with an additional distributive semantics. It is formed by –**V r C1oj/uj. **When the root vowel is –**u** -, the suffix is **–uj** , otherwise it is –**oj.** In the distributive the verb/event acts on each individual component, similar to English: _each one of you_ , instead of just _you._

17.

T’uyul 

E T’uyut’uj. They are seated.

Tak’al 

Oj tak’atoj. We are standing.

Mulan 

E mulumuj. They are gathered together.

K’ulan 

Oj k’uluk’uj. We are married (everyone of us).

Oj k’ulan. We are sitting.

Q’a’l 

E q’a’q’oj. They are leaning.

**Commands and requests for positional verbs**

The imperative of intransitive positional verbs derives from the stative stem. The latter is treated like a regular intransitive imperative stem, taking aspect, and dependent/imperative suffixes. Lesson 27 will deal with these forms specifically.

18.

Q’oy “Lie down”

Q’oyol lying down

Ch-in-q’oyol-oq!  
I shall lie down; let me lie down!

Q’oyola la!  
Lie down (formal, sing)!

Q’oyola alaq/Q’oyol a’laq! You all (formal) lie down!

**Perfective aspect of positional intransitive verbs (we will also look at the perfect in coming lessons)******

The perfective aspect refers to actions begun in the past but whose effects or induced states carry into the present, like the English perfect “I have stood” or “I have sat.” The perfective aspect of the positionals is based on the stative positional stem and the suffix **–inaq.**

19.

T’uy “sit”

T’uyul seated

In t’uyulinaq I have sat

Show/Hide English translation

One day, my grandfather got sick. His stomach hurt. My siblings quickly had a meeting. They were there and I was there, too. We discussed what we were going to do in order to cure him. We decided that it was necessary that some of us went to the doctor (_curandero_). It was also necessary that someone stay with my grandfather. We split up, my aunt would go to her house. My wife came and said to her “Stay a bit, aunt, have something to eat here.” “Alright,” said my aunt. My older brother stayed with my grandfather, we went, with my younger brother and my uncles to the doctor. When we got to his house, my younger brother said “Are you home, sir?”  “I am. Have you been here?” said the doctor. “We haven’t, we came to you; we want we want you to come look at our grandfather because he is very sick (is in a lot of pain)”, said my younger brother. “Alright,” said the doctor, “but it is necessary that you all are there so you can know what is wrong with him.” “Alright, sir,” we all said.  
When we arrived at our house, the doctor came, and he asked my grandfather, “Does something hurt (is something wrong), sir.” “Yes, it does,” said my grandfather. The doctor examined him carefully, he found what was wrong with my grandfather, and then he left him medicine, which is _rora_(ruda) and a sik’ (_puro_). My grandfather was massaged with that and slowly the pain stopped. He was cured. He was happy and said, “There is still sometime with my kids (lit. there are a few days left among my children).” We al got really happy, and then we went to sleep.

Introducción

En esta unidad aprenderemos a formar construcciones imperativas con raíces posicionales.

TZIJONIKTexto

Lupe y Xwan juegan utilizando las formas imperativas de verbos posicionales:

KEMCHI’Gramática

Las formas imperativas de los verbos posicionales intransitivos concuerdan con el Juego B de pronombres. Los sufijos imperativos son **-a** en medio de la oración y **-oq** en posición final de frase. El marcador TAM es **ch-**(o **k-**).

La base del imperativo es la raíz posicional **estativa** , que se forma añadiendo +**V rl** a la raíz, a menos de que la última consonante de la raíz sea **r** o **l,** en cuyo caso el sufijo que se utiliza es +**Vn**.

Las formas imperativas de verbos posicionales transitivos llevan el sufijo **-Vb’a, V** en este caso es la vocal radical.

Ejemplos

**–****Vl**

1.  
Q’oy raíz posicional: acostarse

Q’oyi’(k) acostarse

# Tïjonïk 28: K'ak' le nupo't! (My huipil is new) – Adjectives part 1

![](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/adjective_28_feature-image-825x510.jpg)

![Print Friendly](//cdn.printfriendly.com/button-print-gry20.png)

Introducción

Los adjetivos modifican sustantivos o añaden información descriptiva a un sustantivo o frase nominal. Hay pocos adjetivos en k’iche’. Por lo general tienen la forma CVC. Los posicionales, verbos perfectivos y sustantivos también se utilizan para modificar sustantivos.

*Esta unidad tiene dos partes. El vocabulario y los ejercicios se encunetran en la unidad 29.

TZIJONIKTexto

KEMCHI’Gramática

  1. Los adjetivos pueden añadirse directamente al sustantivo (**atributivo**), por ejemplo:

K’a’n  
bravo

Le e **k’a’na** taq tz’i’  
Los perros bravos

También pueden utilizarse como el predicado de una frase estativa (**predicativo**):

K’ak’  
nuevo(a)

**K’ak’** le nupo’t.  
Mi huipil es nuevo.

A veces algunas ideas que en español se expresan como adjetivos requieren de verbos intransitivos o frases estativas en k’iche’:

  
Wa’ we q’ij, **nim ub’antajik.**  
Este día, grande su-importancia  
Este es un día **importante**.

Num (vi) tener hambre

Kinnumik. Tengo hambre/Estoy hambriento.

Noj (vi) estar lleno

Xinnojik Estoy lleno./Comí lo suficiente.

Ki’kot (vi) estar feliz

Kinki’kotik. estoy feliz.

B’ison (vi) estar triste

Kimb’isonik Estoy triste.

Kos (vi) cansarse

Kinkosik. me canso/estoy cansado.

  2. **Adjetivos como atributos  
**En k’iche’, los adjetivos que se utilizan como atributivos preceden al sustantivo que modifican. Se utiliza la vocal atributiva **a** al adjetivo antes del sustantivo.

nim ‘grande’ + ja ‘casa’= 

Le nima ja la casa grande

saq ‘blanco(a)’ + ja ‘house’= 

Le saqa ja la casa blanca

Itzel ‘malo(a)’ + winaq ‘persona’= 

le itzelalaj winaq mala persona

Le k’ak’a powi’ el sombrero nuevo

Jun q’e’la powi’ un sombrero viejo

Nimatijob’al universidad (lit. la escuela grande)

Nima kej caballo grande

  3. **Sustantivos como atributos de otros sustantivos  
**Cuando los sustantivos funcionan como atributo de otro sustantivo, se conectan con **a**.

kem ‘tejer‘ + tz’ib’ ‘escribr’ =

Kematz’ib’ computadora

kej ‘caballo’ + ch’ich’ ‘artefacto de metal’ =

kejach’ich’ bicicleta

  4. **Sustantivos compuestos poseídos  
**El compuesto “adjetivo-a sustantivo” es una sola palabra; por ende, los adjetivos posesivos se añaden al primer elemento del compuesto.

Jun k’ak’a po’t un huipil nuevo

Xinloq’ le **nuk’ak’apo’t** Me compré un (mi)huipil nuevo.

A’re e **uk’a’na taq tz’i’.** Son sus perros bravos.

  5. **Adjetivos atributivos plurales  
**A los sustantivos plurales con atributivos se les añade la partícula **taq** entre el atributo y el sustantivo. El atributo retiene la vocal **-a.**

Le e q’eqa taq me’s los gatos negros

E k’a’na taq tz’i’ perros bravos

A’re e uk’a’na taq tz’i’ Son sus perros bravos.

Algunos adjetivos tienen formas irregulares en el plural. Cuando forman parte del predicado se añade una glotal.

**Singular** | **Plural/Atributivo** | **Plural/predicatvio**  
---|---|---  
nim (grande) | nimaq | nima’q  
pim (grueso) | pimaq | pima’q  
chom (gordo) | chomaq | choma’q  
nich’ (pequeño) | nich’aq | nich’a’q  
nitz’ (pequeño) | nitz’aq | nitz’a’q  
ch’uti’n (pequeño) | ch’utiq |  ch’uti’q  
  
La partícula **taq** se requiere a pesar del marcador plural del adjetivo. Esta «doble marca» del plural es bastante común en k’iche’:

Le e nitz’aq taq tz’i’  
los perros pequeños

  6. **Adjetivos como predicados  
**Como ya hemos visto, los adjetivos también pueden ser predicados:

E nitz’a’q le taq imul.  
Los conejos son pequeños.

K’ak’ le nupo’t.Mi huipil es nuevo.

**Recordatorio: Colocación de la partícula taq  
**Para pluralizar sustantivos y modificadores, la partícula **taq** se pone entre ellos, inclusive cuando el modificador ya esté marcado como plural:

le saqa taq ja las casas blancas

le nimaq taq tz’i’ los perros grandes

Cuando el adjetivo está en posición de predicado, la partícula **taq** precede al sujeto.

E nima’q taq le tz’i’ Los perros son grandes (estativo).****

Introducción

Esta unidad es la continuación de la unidad 28. Estudiaremos otras construcciones relacionadas a los adjetivos.

TZIJONIKTexto

Como repaso, Lupita nos muestra algunos ejemplos más de adjetivos que califican a sustantivos antes de pasar a otros usos de los adjetivos:

KEMCHI’Gramática

**Adjetivos como sustantivos**  
En k’iche’, los adjetivos pueden tener la función de sustantivos. Cuando se refieren a humanos, toman el sufijo plural (-Vb’):

Alaj pequeño  
alajib’ (los) pequeños

Ri’j viejo, anciano (persona)  
ri’jab’ viejos, ancianos

Ch’u’j loco  
ch’u’jab’ (los) locos

Meb’a’ pobre  
meb’a’ib’ (los)pobres

Q’inom rico  
q’inomab’ (los)ricos

q’or perezoso  
q’orib’ (los) perezosos

**  
Sustantivos abstractos derivados de adjetivos  
**Cuando raíces adjetivales llevan el sufijo **–Vl,** se refieren a la cualidad que expresa el adjetivo o a una relación de posesión inherente (la vocal del sufijo no es regular y debe memorizarse en cada caso)

Pim grueso

E-pimal grosor

Upimal le lej el grosor de la tortilla

Ki’ dulce

E- ki’il dulzura

Uki’il le tara’s la dulzura del durazno

**Intensificación  
**Hay dos formas de intensificar adjetivos: una forma adverbial **sib’alaj** y otra en forma de sufijo: **–****alaj** :

**Sib’alaj  
**Sib’alaj es un adverbio que puede modificar el predicado o verbo de una frase:

Sib’alaj nich’ le nuch’ich’. Mi carro es muy pequeño.

Sib’alaj kaq le apalaj Tu cara está muy roja.

**-alaj  
**El sufijo -alaj intensifica adjetivos y aparece en posición atributiva únicamente. No aparece la **–a** atributiva que generalmente conecta atributo y sustantivo.

Jun nimalaj tz’i’ un perro muy grande

Jun itzelalaj winaq una persona muy mala

Jun utzalaj winaq una persona muy buena

**  
Grado de cualidades adjetivales  
**Los adjetivos en k’iche’ pueden graduarse según el grado de cualidad. El sufijo **-C 1-oj** indica un grado _menor_ de la cualidad expresada en el adjetivo.

Saq blanco/limpio saqsoj un poco blanco/algo limpio

Rax verde/azul raxroj más o menos verde/azul

Kaq red kaqkoj rojizo

Q’an yellow q’anq’oj amarillento

Q’eq negro q’eqq’oj algo negro, un poco negro

Tz’il sucio tz’iltz’oj un poco sucio

Ki’ dulce ki’koj un poco dulce

B’aq delgado b’aqb’oj más o menos delgado

Ch’aqal(ik) mojado ch’aqch’oj (todavía) húmedo

Ch’am agrio ch’amch’oj un poco agrio

K’a amargo k’ak’oj un poco amargo

Tza salado tzatzoj un poco salado

Chom gordo chomchoj un poco gordo

K’ax que duele k’axk’oj que duele un poco

K’axk’oj nujolom. Me duele un poco la cabeza.

**  
Frases comparativas  
**Las frases comparativas requieren el pronombre _are_ en la posición inicial y el sustantivo relacional **ch(i)–E-wach**. Los ejemplos abajo utilizan la tercera persona singular (**ch-u-wach)** ya que comparan objetos que no son el hablante o interlocutor.

Are _nim_ le atz’i’ _chuwach_ le nutz’i’.  
grande tu perro en comparación a mi perro.  
Tu perro es más grande que mi perro.

Are sib’alaj _kaq_ le apo’t _chuwach_ le nupo’t  
muy rojo tu huipil en comparación a mi huipil  
Tu huipil es más rojo que mi huipil.

Sib’alaj _aninaq kach’aw_ le are’ _chinuwach in  
_muy rápido habla él en comparación a mí  
Él habla más rápido que yo.

Para negación: «Él no es más **X** que…» el adjetivo o verbo se niega de la misma manera que conocemos, con **na…taj.**

Are na nim ta le atz’i’ chuwach le nutz’i’.  
Tu perro no es más grande que mi perro.

Are na aninaq ta kach’aw chinuwach in.  
El no habla más rápido que yo.

**Superlativos  
**Para expresar superlativos se utilizan frases comparativas o el adverbio sib’alaj con un tono ascendente y pronunciación alargada.

**Derivación versiva  
**De un verbo intransitivo se pueden derivar adjetivos/sustantivos que significan: _ponerse_ X, _hacerse_ X, o _adquirir la cualidad X_. Este verbo «versivo» se construye añadiendo el sufijo **–Vrik** a la raíz adjetival. La vocal varía y debe memorizarse en cada caso. El sufijo **-ik** es un marcador de frase final, y se omite cuando el verbo no está en posición final. Tenga en cuenta que no todos los adjetivos/sustantivos tienen una derivación versiva. Los que se derivan de raíces posicionales utilizan el sufijo **–Vb’ik**.

# Tïjonïk 30: Xkunax le yawab' (The sick one was healed) – Passive constructions

Introducción

En k’iche’ hay dos construcciones pasivas que enfatizan el objeto del verbo sin expresar el sujeto. Nos referimos a ellas simplemente como Pasivo I y Pasivo II. En esta unidad estudiaremos el Pasivo I y continuaremos con el Pasivo II en la siguiente.

TZIJONIKTexto

En este video, Nela le pide ayuda a Nan Xe’p pues su hijo está enfermo.

KEMCHI’Gramática

En la voz pasiva, el _objeto_ de un verbo transitivo se convierte en el _sujeto_ de la frase verbal pasiva. Los verbos pasivos son intransitivos, lo que significa que solo un argumento, el sujeto, se marca en el verbo con pronombres del juego B. En el pasivo, el _agente_ __ no se marca dentro del verbo. Puede expresarse de manera oblicua y debe ser presentado (cuando así se quiera) por medio del sustantivo relacional **-umal**. En español, los agentes de construcciones pasivas se presentan con **por**. Por ejemplo:

Activo:

  1. Xukunaj le yawab’ le aj q’ij  
Él curo el enfermo el sacerdote maya  
**V O A**  
_El sacerdote maya curó al enfermo.  
_

Pasivo:

  2. Xkunax le yawab’ (rumal le aj q’ij)  
se curó/fue curado el enfermo (por el sacerdote)  
**V S (oblique)**  
_El enfermo fue curado (por el sacerdote)_

Ya que los verbos pasivos solo pueden contener un argumento, usamos pronombres del juego B para marcar el sujeto. El pasivo funciona como un verbo intransitivo y, como tal, utiliza el marcador –**ik** en posición final.

**PASIVO I  
**El pasivo se marca en el verbo de la siguiente manera:****

**Verbos transitivos no-CVC:****-x + (ik**) (la **–x** reemplaza la **–j** de la forma activa)

  3. Xukunaj (activo) ‘El/Ella lo curó’  

Xkunaxik (pasivo) ‘El/Ella fue curado/a.’

**Verbos transitivos CVC** : **alargamiento de la vocal de raíz****\+ (ik)**

  4. Xuchapo (active) ‘Él lo agarró’  
Xchapik (passive) ‘Fue agarrado’

Para expresar el sujeto de la voz pasiva se utiliza el sustantivo relacional I –**umal**.

  5. Xkunax le yawab’ **rumal le ajq’ij.  
**El enfermo fue curado **por el sacerdote maya.**

Sin embargo, esto **solo** es posible en Pasivo I si el agente está en **tercera persona**(por él/ella/ellos). Para expresar agentes en otras personas se debe utilizar la voz activa.

El hombre fue curado por mí.  

Xinkunaj le achi. (active)  
*Xkunax le achi wumal (esta construcción no es permitida)

Ya hemos visto, también, que no podemos tener un **agente en tercera persona** junto a un **objeto en segunda persona formal** en una construcción de verbo transitivo. La misma idea, sin embargo, puede expresarse a través de una construcción pasiva.

*Xukunaj la Él lo curó a usted _(formal)_

Para estas construcciones se utiliza el pasivo:

  6. Xkunax la rumal.  
__Usted fue curado por él.__
  7. Kakunax la rumal.  
_Usted será curado por él._

Más ejemplos de construcciones en pasivo I:

  8. Xukunaj le ala le ixoq.  
La mujer curó al muchacho.  

Xkunax le ala (rumal le ixoq).  
El muchacho fue curado (por la mujer).  

Le ala xkunaxik.  
El muchacho fue curado.
  9. Xkichap le tz’i’ le alab’om.  
Los muchachos agarraron al perro.  

Xchap le tz’i’ (kumal le alab’om).  
El perro fue agarrado (por los muchachos).  

Le tz’i’ xchapik.  
El perro fue agarrado.
  10. Xeril le taq wakax le ali.  
La muchacha vio las vacas.  

Xe’il le taq wakax (rumal le ali).  
Las vacas fueron vistas (por la muchacha).  

Le wakax xe’ilik.  
Las vacas fueron vistas

  11. Xatkito’ ri achijab’.  
Los hombres te ayudaron.  

Xatto’ (kumal ri achijab’).  
Fuiste ayudado(a) (por los hombres).  

Xatto’ik.  
Fuiste ayudado(a).NOTA: Algunos dialectos no tienen distinciones entre vocales largas y cortas. Hay que tener presente que tal vez no podamos percibir la distinción en duración de la vocal, y por eso debemos poner mucha atención a las personas que se marcan en transitivos radicales.  
De estas frases, ¿cuál significa “Él encontró al perro” y cuál “El perro fue encontrado”? 

Xriq le tz’i’.

Xuriq le tz’i’.

# Tïjonïk 31: Kab'antajik le sub' (How to make tamales) – Passive constructions II

Introducción

A diferencia del Pasivo I, el Pasivo II (o pasivo completivo) enfatiza el resultado final de la acción verbal o el estado final del objeto. Se refiere a acciones que han terminado o que se han llevado a cabo completamente. Se usa en la descripción de procesos como los pasos de una receta (una vez que _x_ se hace, entonces…). Veremos un ejemplo en el _tzijonik_ en el que Nan Xe’p nos explica cómo hacer _sub’ (_ tamales) que suelen acompañar las comidas.

TZIJONIKTexto

En el siguiente video, Nan Xe’p nos explica cómo se hacen los _sub’_ _:_

KEMCHI’Gramática

El pasivo II enfatiza el resultado del evento o acción verbal o su resultado final. El sufijo correspondiente es **–(V)taj,** el cual se usa con los verbos de **raíz** (CVC) y con los transitivos **derivados** (no-CVC). La vocal **V** en **-(V)taj** se elide o se omite con frecuencia. Cuando está presente es generalmente la misma vocal que la de la raíz. Como estas formas verbales son intransitivas toman **-ik** en posición final.

Ejemplos:

kunaj: curar, sanar

Xkikunaj le ali ri ixoqib’.  
Las mujeres curaron a la niña.

Xkunataj le ali (kumal ri ixoqib’).  
La niña fue curada (por las mujeres).

Le ali xkunatajik.  
La niña se curó.

B’an(o): hacer

Kub’ano.  
Lo hace; Lo está haciendo; Lo hará.

Kab’anik.  
Se está haciendo; Se hace; Se hará

Kab’antajik.  
Se está llevando a cabo; Se ha llevado a cabo; Se llevará a cabo..

En el Pasivo II el agente se introduce opcionalmente con **E-umal:**

La xkunataj le ali awumal?  
La x-kunataj le ali aw-umal?  
Fue curada por ti la niña?

Las frases con sujetos impersonales como «Se puede X» o «Puede ser X-ado» se dicen con el pasivo II.

Kak’oxomatajik.  
Puede entenderse

Keta’matajik.  
Puede aprenderse.

Kachomatajik  
Se arregla; Se soluciona.

Kakunatajik  
Se cura; Se puede curar.

Na kab’antaj ta wumal  
No puedo hacerlo; No tengo tiempo para hacerlo. Lit: no será hecho por mí (esto es lo que puedes responder como respuesta a alguien que te pide que hagas algo por esa persona)

# Tïjonïk 32: Ketikon ri achijab' (The men plant) – Antipassive I

![Print Friendly](//cdn.printfriendly.com/button-print-gry20.png)

Introducción

En K’iche’ se utiliza el antipasivo para topicalizar el agente de un verbo transitivo. Se le llama antipasivo porque se puede conceptualizar como una construcción opuesta a la forma pasiva. Como ya sabemos, en construcciones pasivas, se topicaliza el objeto y se desenfatiza el agente del verbo. Al contrario, en construcciones antipasivas se enfatiza o topicaliza el agente. Los verbos antipasivos son intransitivos y se marcan con marcadores del juego B. Existen dos construcciones antipasivas en k’iche’:

  * **Antipasivo Absolutivo** (AP I)
  * **Antipasivo de enfoque** (o construcción de enfoque del agente) (AP II).

El **antipasivo absolutivo**(AP I) enfatiza la acción y desenfatiza el objeto, el cual se infiere la mayoría del tiempo. El objeto se puede introducir de manera oblicua con una frase preposicional encabezada por ch(i)-E-e(ch).

El **absolutivo de enfoque del agente** (AP II) enfatiza los agentes verbales (A) (ver unidad 33).

TZIJONIKTexto

Escuche las siguientes frases:

Sib’alaj kaq’ilon le pare pa le tyox.  
El padre aconseja mucho en la iglesia.

Rajawaxik katloq’on chech ri awajil atz’aqat.  
Es necesario que ames a tus vecinos.

Katajin katzib’an le al Mari’y.  
Mariy está escribiendo.

Waral kak’ayin wi le al Xe’p.  
Aquí compra Xe’p. (Aquí hace las compras Xe’p).

Na kakayen ta le me’s, xew le tz’i’ kakayenik.  
El gato no muerde. Solo el perro muerde.

Kachakun le numam pa le abix.  
Mi abuelo trabaja en la milpa.

Kach’ajan le ak’al pa le tuj.  
El niño (se) baña en el temazcal.

KEMCHI’Gramática

El **antipasivo****absolutivo**(AP I) enfatiza la acción y desplaza el objeto, que generalmente se infiere. También se puede presentar como frase preposicional oblicua, encabezada por ch(i)-E-e(ch).

Como mencionamos antes, las formas antipasivas son intransitivas, por lo cual se usan los marcadores pronominales del juego B para señalar la concordancia de sujeto. También llevan el sufijo –**ik** en posición final de frase.

1.

Kakitik ixim ri achijab’.  
Los hombres siembran maíz.

2.

Ketikon ri achijab’.  
Los hombres siembran.

3.

Ketikonik  
Ellos siembran.

El ejemplo 1 demuestra la construcción activa, en la cual el agente se marca con pronombre de juego A y el objeto con pronombre de juego B. Al contrario, en las construcciones antipasivas de los ejemplos 2 y 3, la tercera persona plural se marca con el pronombre -e- del juego B.

**Objetos en la construcción del antipasivo absolutivo  
**En el antipasivo absolutivo los objetos **no se pueden** expresar **directamente**. Se introduce con el sustantivo relacional **ch-e (ch-ech)** , formando lo que los lingüistas llaman un «objeto oblicuo.»

4.

Kinuloq’oj le nutat.  
My papá me quiere.

5.

Kaloq’on le nutat **chwe.**  
Mi papa me quiere.

En términos semánticos, la construcción activa del ejemplo 4 y la construcción antipasiva del ejemplo 5 son iguales. La diferencia es el enfoque pragmático, que en español generalmente se expresa con un tono ascendiente en el elemento que se quiere enfatizar. El ejemplo 4 no solo transmite el sentimiento de cariño que el padre le tiene al hablante. Más bien clarifica que el sentimiento es amor y no otro efecto que los interlocutores suponen. A menudo el objeto no es necesario ya que es obvio por el contexto. Sin embargo, como señalamos antes, si se necesita se presenta como objeto oblicuo con ch -E, como vemos en el ejemplo 5.

Frases verbales transitivas que aparecen con complemento directo pierden este complemento en antipasivo I:

Activo:  
6.

**Kinb’isoj uwach** le wal.  
Extraño a mi hijo./ Estoy triste por mi hijo.

AP I:  
7.

Kinbison che le wal.  
Extraño a mi hijo./ Estoy triste por mi hijo.  
****

**Morfología del antipasivo absolutivo (Antipasivo I)  
**La raíz verbal antipasiva lleva el sufijo –(**V)n(ik)**

**Transitivos derivados (no-CVC)** se quita la **–j** de la voz activa y se sustituye con **–n,**

8.

Kinq’ojom**aj** le q’ojom.  
Toco la marimba (**activo**).

9.

Kinq’ojom**anik.  
**Toco (música) (**antipassive**).****

**Transitivos derivados (CVC)** se añade el sufijo **– (V)n.** La vocal se determina de acuerdo a las siguientes reglas:

**Regla** | **Ejemplo**  
---|---  
si la vocal de raíz es **u** entonces **–un** | k’ut > -k’ut**un**(ik)  
si la vocal de raíz es **a** entonces **–an** | tz’aj > -tz’aj**an**(ik)  
todas las otras vocales de raíz (e, i, o), entonces **-on** | tij > -tij**on**(ik)  
verbos transitivos que terminan en glotal (**‘**) **–n.** |  su’ > -su’n(ik)  
  
**Formas irregulares** :

**Activo** | **Antipasivo I** | **Traducción**  
---|---|---  
to'(o) | -tob’an(ik) | ayudar  
t’is(o) | -t’iso’man(ik) | coser  
loq’(o) | -loq’oman(ik) | comprar  
  
**  
Verbos transitivos que no se usan en antipasivo absolutivo (AP I):  
**Los siguientes verbos generalmente no se dan en el pasivo absolutivo.

**Raíz verbal** | **Traducción** | *Gramaticalmente incorrecto  
---|---|---  
aj | querer | *kinajanik  
b’an | hacer | *kinb’ananik  
ya’ | dar | *kinya’nik  
k’is | terminar |  *kink’isinik  
  
**Antipasivo de los verbos tij “comer” y tijoj “enseñar”  
**El antipasivo “**tijon(ik)”** de **tij** “comer” es una frase idiomática que quiere decir «comer carne humana» (como lo haría un animal). **No** es un antipasivo regular del verbo «comer.» El verbo –wa(ik) la ha reemplazado. **Tijon(ik)** también puede ser el antipasivo de «enseñar.»

**Usos del antipasivo absolutivo:******

**Desenfatizar el objeto** : El objeto es obvio, se presupone, o no es importante.

t’is to sew  
10.

Kut’is ri pantalon.  
El(la) cose el pantalón _._

11.

Kat’iso’manik.  
El(la) cose.

**Para evitar ambigüedad con honoríficos:** Cláusulas transitivas con primera persona singular (**in**) y segunda persona formal (**la/alaq** ; singular o plural) son ambiguas. El antipasivo absolutivo se puede usar para clarificar qué persona es el agente y qué persona el objeto.

12.

Kintzukuj la.  
Lo busco (a usted) (formal) **o** Usted (formal) me busca

13.

Kintzukun che la.  
Lo busco (a usted) (antipasivo).

14.

Katzukun la chwe.  
Usted me busca (antipasivo).

15.

Kinto’ la.  
Lo ayudo (a usted) **o** Usted me ayuda (activo)

16.

Kintob’an che la.

# Tïjonïk 33: Are le nunan xb'anowik (My mother made it) – Antipassive II

Introducción

En k’iche’ la posición en frente del verbo se reserva para señalar «atención especial» o «énfasis,» también conocido como Enfoque o Tópico. El orden de palabras estándar en k’iche’ es VS (verbo, sujeto) para frases intransitivas y VOA (verbo, objeto, agente) para frases transitivas. Sin embargo, las partes de la frase pueden moverse al frente del verbo para darles énfasis.

Dependiendo de qué tipo de énfasis el hablante desee, y dependiendo de qué parte de la frase se ponga al frente, otros cambios pueden darse en la frase.

**Tópico** describe «**de qué se trata** la conversación/texto/discurso.» En k’iche’ el objeto o sujeto/agente de la frase puede moverse al frente del verbo para apuntar al **tópico**. Ningún otro cambio se requiere en la frase.

**Enfoque** describe información nueva o que contradice la información que se presupone o asume. Cuando el agente de una frase transitiva se enfoca y se mueve al frente del verbo, el verbo debe cambiar a la **voz antipasiva de enfoque**(AP II). Los _objetos_ (siempre de una frase transitiva) se pueden mover al frente del verbo _sin_ desatar ningún otro cambio en la morfología.

TZIJONIKTexto

Nela and Silveria hablan sobre quién hizo el huipil:

KEMCHI’Gramática

Mientras que el Antipasivo Absolutivo (Antipasivo I) se utiliza principalmente en contextos en los cuales de desplaza el objeto, el **Antipasivo de Enfoque**(Antipasivo II) se utiliza cuando el **Agente** (o sujeto de una frase transitiva) se **enfatiza** o **enfoca**. El **Enfoque de agente** significa que en el texto o discurso se le presta especial atención al agente o sujeto de la cláusula transitiva. También se pueden enfatizar otras partes de la frase, pero cuando es el agente que se enfatiza, el verbo en k’iche’ señala este énfasis a través de un cambio de morfología (el uso del Antipasivo II).

En la siguiente frase el Agente (en negrita) se enfoca para producir contraste. Nótese la construcción «fue… que/quien…» que a menudo, aunque no siempre, puede utilizarse para traducir estas frases.

**Fue Tomás** quien me llamó ayer.

La gramática del k’iche’ refleja este enfoque con una morfología verbal especial y un cambio en el orden estándar de las palabras:

(1) El verbo debe cambiarse a la voz antipasiva de enfoque

(2) La parte de la frase que se enfoca se pone al frente del verbo y a menudo es precedida por **are**(El orden de palabras estándar para cláusulas transitivas es VOA).

**Are le Max** **xinch’aben** iwir.

******Morfología**

**Transitivos Derivado** **(no-CVC):** el antipasivo II es igual al antipasivo absolutivo:**-Vn-(ik)******

**Transitivos Radicales (CVC)** :  
El antipasivo II se forma con el sufijo **–ow(ik)** ,  
con la exepción de raíces **CuC** en las cuales el sufijo es –**uw(ik)** :

t**i** j > tij**ow** | k’**o** t > k’ot**ow** | k’**u** t > k’ut**uw**  
---|---|---  
  
**  
Transitivos Radicales que finalizan en glotal (CV’)  
**Si una raíz transitiva finaliza en glotal, (**su’**), la raíz del antipasivo es **C-V’w.  
**Las vocales cambian de acuerdo a las reglas anteriores:  
Ca, e, o’ > o’w  
Cu’ > u’w

Nótese que las raíces **Ci’** cambian a **Cyo’w**

su’ > su’w | limpiar  
---|---  
to’ > to’w | ayudar  
sa’ > so’w | secar (ante el sol, el fuego…)  
ya’ > yo’w (yo’w se convierta en yo’ al final de una frase) | dar  
ti’ > tyo’w | morder (perros)  
  
**  
Usos del Antipasivo de enfoque (AP II)  
**El antipasivo II se usa para lo siguiente:

  1. Para dar un enfoque contrastante al agente (_fue Tomás que_ …)
  2. Para negar el agente (_no fue Tomás que…_)
  3. Para hacer preguntas sobre el agente (_Quién fue el que hizo esto?_)
  4. En cláusulas relativas (agente) _(el hombre que hizo esto…)_
  5. Cuando la frase del agente incluye incorporación.

Para enfocar el agente, la frase nominal se pone al frente del verbo. El orden de palabras para el antipasivo de enfoque es AVO.

Para el antipasivo de enfoque, uno de los participantes, A ó O, debe estar en la tercera persona (singular o plural), **o** lal/alaq.

Si **ninguno de los dos** A y O es de la tercera persona/lal/alaq, se utiliza la voz activa.

(a)

In xatinch’ayo.  
Fui yo el que te pegó.

**Manejo de los objetos en Antipasivo II  
**Al contrario del Antipasivo Absolutivo, donde los objetos solo pueden aparecer en construcciones oblicuas, (con ch-E-e(ch)), el Antipasivo de Enfoque **permite objetos directos** en la frase.

Sin embargo, el antipasivo es, morfológicamente, intransitivo, por lo tanto, solo hay un (1) espacio para pronombres, y se marca **solamente con pronombres del juego B.** Cómo resolvemos el problema de tener dos argumentos, agente y objeto, y solo un espacio?

En el antipasivo de enfoque (AP II) el pronombre absolutivo (juego B) concuerda con la persona que está más alto en la «jerarquía de animidad»:

1era, 2da > 3ra plural > 3ra singular (la 2da persona formal se trata como la 3ra singular).

In xinch’ayow le achi.  
Fui yo el que le pegó al hombre.

Are ri achi xinch’ayowik.  
Fue el hombre que me pegó.

Para verbos no-CVC o transitivos derivados, el antipasivo de enfoque se ve exactamente como el antipasivo absolutivo: -Vn(ik).

Kinuloq’oj le nutat.  
Mi papá me quiere (activo).

Le nutat ka**loq’on** chwe.  
Mi papá me quiere (antipasivo absolutivo/AP I).

Are le nutat kin**loq’on** ik.  
Es mi papá el que me quiere (antipasivo de enfoque/AP II).

Xinaxib’ij pa b’e.  
Me asustaste en el camino (activo).

At xin**xib’in** pa b’e.  
Fuiste vos el que me asustó en el camino (AP II).

Arriba dijimos que el antipasivo de enfoque sólo se puede usar si el A u O está en la tercera persona. Sin embargo, porque la **2da persona formal** no se marca en el verbo, en este caso **se trata como 3ra persona**. Verbos con enfoque de agente se pueden marcar con dos personas gramaticales que no estén en la 3ra persona **si** uno de ellos está en la 2da persona formal.

Xinto’ la.  
Usted me ayudó. Yo lo ayudé (a usted) (activo).

Lal xinto’wik.  
Fue usted el que me ayudó.

Xinto’w la  
Fui yo el que lo ayudó (a usted).

A’re xeto’w alaq.

# Tïjonïk 34: Ri ixjut (The worm) – Demonstrative articles

![](https://tzij.coerll.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/demonstrative-articles_34_feature-image-825x510.jpg)

![Print Friendly](//cdn.printfriendly.com/button-print-gry20.png)

Introducción

El artículo indefinido **jun** en k’iche’ es equivalente a «un» en español, pero también puede significar el número «uno.»

Artículos definidos: K’iche’ usa tres artículos definidos **we** , **le** o **ri**. Corresponden más o menos, en español, a este, ese, o aquel. Cuál se usa depende principalmente en la proximidad física o imaginada del hablante y de la visibilidad del objeto del que se habla.

Además, los artículos **ri/le/we** no sólo se refieren a la proximidad física, sino también a distancia temporal: **ri** se refiere a cosas en el pasado, o que todavía no se han hecho; **le** se refiere a cosas que se han hecho recientemente, con importancia en el presente; **we** se refiere a cosas que acaban de hacerse, o que están sucediendo en el presente.

Es importante recordar que el uso de los demostrativos depende de la perspectiva personal y no necesariamente de una regla absoluta. El hablante puede indicar proximidad emocional a un evento con el uso de artículos demostrativos, por ejemplo.

“Artículo estándar”: En Nahualá, el artículo estándar es “le.”

TZIJONIKTexto

A continuación escucharemos una historia sobre el gusano y su transformación:

KEMCHI’Gramática

A continuación veremos el uso de los artículos demostrativos:

**WE** se usa para objetos que están cercanos al hablante, a su alcance.

1.

Utz we nutz’i’.  
Este mi perro es bueno (junto a mí).

2.

We achi xusipaj chwe jun p’ot.  
Este hombre me regaló un huipil.

**LE** se usa para objetos que no están tan cerca, pero que son visibles al hablante.

3.

Utz le nutz’i’.  
Ese mi perro es bueno (que puedo ver).

**RI** se usa para objetos que no son visibles al hablante. En cuentos o historias, **ri** se refiere a cosas ya conocidas, o que se hayan presentado previamente. En otras variantes del k’iche’, **ri** es el artículo estándar, mientras que en Nahualá se prefiere **le.**

4.

Utz ri nutz’i’.  
Aquel mi perro es bueno (que no puedo ver).

**Pronombres relativos.  
**Estos artículos**ri/le/we** también funcionan como pronombres relativos.

**we** |  que/quien (junto a mí, evento reciente)  
---|---  
  
5\. 

We achi we…  
Este hombre, quien/que…

6.

Utz we nutz’i’ we xisipaj chwe.  
Este mi perro, que ustedes me regalaron, es bueno.

7.

Utz we achi we xinkunanik.  
Este hombre que me curó es bueno.

**le** | que/quien (ahí, visible, o evento reciente)  
---|---  
  
8.

Le achi le…  
El hombre que…

9.

Utz le nutz’i’ le xisipaj chwe.  
Ese perro que ustedes me regalaron es bueno.

10.

Utz le achi le xinkunanik.  
El hombre que me curó es bueno.

11.

Xpe le achi le xinkunaj iwir.  
Vino el hombre que curé ayer.

12.

La xpe le achi le xinkunan iwir?  
¿Vino el hombre que me curó ayer?

**ri** | que/quien (no a la vista; ausente de donde está el hablante; evento que no se ha hecho o que se hizo en el pasado)  
---|---  
  
13.

Ri achi ri…  
El hombre que…

14.

Utz ri nutz’i’ ri xisipaj chwe.  
Aquel perro que ustedes me regalaron es bueno.

Aunque es posible utilizar artículos con pronombres relativos distintos, algunas combinaciones son preferibles:

(Artículo) **we** casi siempre se usa con **we** (pronombre relativo)

15\. 

**We** achi **we** xusipaj jun po’t chwe xkamik.  
Este hombre que me regaló un huipil se murió.

Una combinación estándar es **le** seguido por **ri.**

16\. 

**Le** wuj **ri** xasipaj chwe sib’alaj utz kinwilo.  
Me gusta mucho el libro que me regalaste.

**Ri** \+ **wi** : pronombre relativo locativo (donde).  
**Ri** (pronombre relativo) junto a **wi** resulta en un pronombre relativo locativo, que significa «donde.»

17.

Le nimatijob’al **ri kak’ut wi** ri qach’ab’al, sib’alaj naj k’o wi.  
La escuela donde se enseña nuestro idioma (k’iche’) está lejos.

**Jas(a)** puede combinarse con **we/le/ri** para presentar cláusulas de objeto subordinadas:

18.

Chitatab’ej jas we kimb’ij.  
Escuchen esto que digo (en este momento).

19.

Chitatab’ej jas le kimb’ij.  
Escuchen lo que digo (aquí y ahora).

20.

Chitatab’ej jasa ri kimb’ij.

21.

Introducción

Los pronombres son palabras que pueden sustituir sustantivos, nombres y frases. Al igual que los artículos demostrativos, los pronombres demostrativos también indican la distancia entre el hablante y el objeto al que se refiere. Los pronombres demostrativos son **wa’** , **la’** and **ri’**. Cuando aparecen por sí solos, se posponen al sustantivo. Corresponden en forma a los artículos demostrativos.

KEMCHI’Gramática

**wa’** | Esto/Este (muy cerca del hablante) acompañado por **we**  
---|---  
  
1.

Chikop wa’.  
Esto (muy cerca) es un animal.

2.

Are wa’.  
Esto (muy cerca) es.

**la’** | Eso/Ese (a la vista del hablante, o si se habla como sobre el objeto como si estuviera a la vista) acompañado por **le**  
---|---  
  
3.

Me’s la’.  
Eso/Ese (allá) es un gato.

**ri’** | Aquello (algo que no está presente o no está a la vista, algo que se hizo en el pasado, o que no se ha hecho, acompañado por **ri**)  
---|---  
  
4.

Kej ri’.  
Aquello es un caballo.

Los siguientes ejemplos demuestran cómo estos pronombres pueden sustituir sustantivos, verbos, frases:

5.

Ajchak _we ala._  
Este muchacho es un trabajador.

6.

Ajchak wa’.  
Esto es un trabajador.

7.

Nim _we ab’aj._  
Esta piedra es grande.

8.

Nim wa’.  
Esta es grande.

9.

Es bueno lo que trabajo.

10.

Utz wa’.  
Esto es bueno!

11.

13.

K’a’n _le tz’i’.  
_El perro es bravo..

14.

K’a’n la’.  
Ese es bravo.

15.

Utz _le xub’ij_ _le achi._  
Lo que dijo el hombre es bueno.

16.

Utz la’.  
Eso es bueno.

17.

(Aquella) Se quebró.

21.

K’ax _ri kach’awik._  
Es duro lo que dice/como habla.

22.

K’ax ri’.  
Eso es duro.

Los pronombres demostrativos pueden utilizarse con artículos demostrativos para intensificarlos. En este caso el pronombre precede al artículo. Pronombres que no están en 3ra persona también se pueden enfatizar con pronombres demostrativos:

23.

**Wa’ we** achi.  
Este hombre (aquí).

24.

**La’ le** achi.  
Ese hombre (allá).

25.

**Ri’ ri** achi.  
Aquel hombre.

26.

In wa’ we kiny’ow le tzijonem.  
**Yo** soy el que va a dar la plática (aquí).

27\. 

La at ri’ ri katyo’w le tzijonem?  
Eres **tú** el que va a dar la plática (aquí)?

También pueden combinarse con pronombres o artículos para formar clausulas relativas.

28.

K’ax ri’ ri kach’awik.  
Es duro (eso) que dice.

29.

Utz la’ le xub’ij le achi.  
Es bueno (eso) que el hombre dijo.

Todas las noches miro al cielo, observo una estrellita con su luz resplandeciente, solitaria, su resplandor: da paz y tranquilidad en mi corazón. Una noche Salí frente a mi casa, contemplé a mi pueblo, vi a un grupo de hombres y mujeres que venían, estaban muy tristes. Cuando pasaron conmigo me dejaron dicho que fueron nuevamente a visitar a la gran autoridad, cuando escuche esto me puse muy triste porque tal vez los vuelvan a pegar como paso la última vez.

Estrellita: tal vez sepas el sufrimiento de mi pueblo, envía un poco de tu resplandor, de paz que se encuentra contigo, ya no quiero ver el sufrimiento de nuestros padres. Sueño ese día en que vengas conmigo, para que cualquiera que contemple mi casa, sienta un poco de paz, de alegría. Un día quiero ir contigo, ir a verte, bailar juntos en el lugar en donde se te fue dado el resplandor. Sé que por la lejanía quizás ya no regrese a mi pueblo, pero si ya no regreso, los dos enviaremos el resplandor de la paz, la alegría a los hombres, las mujeres, nuestros padres, nuestros abuelos y también a los niños que buscan la paz, porque así como tú, así como yo, así como todas las personas, todos tienen el resplandor de la paz, la alegría en el fondo de sus corazones.

KEMCHI’Gramática

El k’iche’ tiene un juego de partículas direccionales post-verbales que le añaden un sentido de trayectoria al evento. Esta trayectoria tiene como lugar de diferencia el hablante o el _origo deíctico_ de la acción. La deixis es un concepto lingüístico que tiene que ver con puntos de diferencia. El _origo deíctico_ se refiere a la perspectiva desde donde se habla del evento. __

**Direccionales en k’iche’** :

_la/ (u)loq_ | hacia el _origo_  
---|---  
_b’i(k)_ | en sentido opuesto al _origo_  
_kan(oq)_ | _origo_ ya no es parte de la escena; referencia temporal: el pasado  
_apan(oq)_ | movimiento entre el hablante y un lugar cercano  
_aq’an(oq)_ | movimiento hacia arriba; referencia temporal: el futuro  
_qaj(oq)_ | movimiento hacia abajo, movimiento vertical  
_koq/ka_ |  hacia adentro; movimiento horizontal al nivel de los ojos  
  
Ejemplo:  

Xekanaj kan le ajchakib’.  
Se quedaron (allá, fuera de escena) los trabajadores.

«Los trabajadores» son el sujeto de esta frase. Sin embargo, el direccional _kan_ revela que se habla de la acción desde una perspectiva que no está en lugar donde se llevó a cabo la acción.

Generalmente los direccionales pueden traducirse de la siguiente manera: (VERBO PRINCIPAL) + “alejarse/acercarse/salir/venir/dejar/subir/bajar/entrar»

Algunas formas direccionales cambian de acuerdo a su entorno fonológico; tienen una forma en medio de frase y una forma en posición final de frase, y a veces se funden con otras partículas. También le dan un sentido específico a ciertos verbos, por ejemplo:

k’am+ b’ik “llevar (hacia allá)”

k’am + uloq “traer (hacia acá)”

**la/ (u)loq****  
** Esta forma se utiliza cuando la acción tiene lugar _hacia_ donde se encuentra el hablante. Cuando no está en posición final, su forma es _la_. _Uloq_ pierde su primera vocal (_u_), cuando la palabra que la precede termina en vocal o sonido parecido a una vocal.

1.

Le achi xka’y loq.  
El hombre miró hacia acá (hacia el hablante).

2.

Iwir xintzalij uloq.  
Regresé (aquí) ayer.

3.

We k’o arajil chak’ama loq.  
Si tenés dinero, traélo (aquí).

Nótese que la diferencia entre «llevar» y «traer» en k’iche’ es la partícula direccional que acompaña el verbo – _k’am_ :

_-k’am_ \+ _b’ik_ “llevar (allá)”

_-k’am + uloq_ “traer (aquí)”

4.

We k’o arajil, chak’ama la chwe’q.  
Si tenés dinero, traélo (aquí) mañana.

5.

Iwir xujtzalij la pa k’ayb’al.

Na…taj + la > Na…tu’la  
  
10.

**B’i(k)****  
** Esta forma se utiliza con acciones que incluyen movimiento alejándose del hablante o del _origo deíctico._ Cuando no está en posición final, _b’ik_ se transforma en _b’i_.

Todas las noches miro al cielo, observo una estrellita con su luz resplandeciente, solitaria, su resplandor: da paz y tranquilidad en mi corazón. Una noche Salí frente a mi casa, contemplé a mi pueblo, vi a un grupo de hombres y mujeres que venían, estaban muy tristes. Cuando pasaron conmigo me dejaron dicho que fueron nuevamente a visitar a la gran autoridad, cuando escuche esto me puse muy triste porque tal vez los vuelvan a pegar como paso la última vez.

Estrellita: tal vez sepas el sufrimiento de mi pueblo, envía un poco de tu resplandor, de paz que se encuentra contigo, ya no quiero ver el sufrimiento de nuestros padres. Sueño ese día en que vengas conmigo, para que cualquiera que contemple mi casa, sienta un poco de paz, de alegría. Un día quiero ir contigo, ir a verte, bailar juntos en el lugar en donde se te fue dado el resplandor. Sé que por la lejanía quizás ya no regrese a mi pueblo, pero si ya no regreso, los dos enviaremos el resplandor de la paz, la alegría a los hombres, las mujeres, nuestros padres, nuestros abuelos y también a los niños que buscan la paz, porque así como tú, así como yo, así como todas las personas, todos tienen el resplandor de la paz, la alegría en el fondo de sus corazones.

KEMCHI’Gramática

Los verbos en k’iche’ pueden incluir partículas que denotan movimiento a la acción del verbo, como en español _ir_ _a (hacer algo)_ , o  _venir_ _a (hacer algo)_. A esto le llamamos movimiento incorporado.

X**e’** nwil**a** le etz’anem oxjir.  
Fui a ver el juego hace tres días.

Las dos partículas que se insertan (-**e’** – y –**ul** -) se derivan de los verbos intransitivos **ul** (venir aquí/llegar) y **b’e**(ir). En el k’iche’ estándar –**e’-** aparece como **–b’e’.**

Verbos con movimiento incorporado utilizan los mismos sufijos que los **imperativos**.

**Verbos intransitivos con movimiento:  
**En verbos intransitivos con movimiento, el acento de la palabra pasa de la última a la penúltima sílaba cuando no están en posición de final de frase:

No-final: kin**e’** xojów**a** |  final de frase: kin**e’** xojow-**oq**  
---|---  
  
**Verbos transitivos con movimiento:**  
La raíz de verbos transitivos no-CVC no cambian cuando se incorpora movimiento.

Los verbos transitivos CVC con movimiento usan los mismos sufijos que los imperativos. También se añade una glotal después de la vocal final cuando el verbo está en posición final de frase: ****

–**V** |  –**V’**  
---|---  
No-final: k**e’** nwil-**a** |  Final: k**e** ’nwil-**a’**  
CoC > **o** | CoC > ****o******’**  
CuC > **u** |  CuC > ****u******’**  
Ca/e/iC > **a** |  Ca/e/iC > **a’**  
  
**Orden de los elementos:  
**Las partículas de movimiento se insertan entre el marcador de aspecto y la raíz del verbo. A continuación veremos el orden de los eventos (hay algunas excepciones):

Verbos intransitivos:

TAM – Juego B – **MOV** – Raíz – Marcador de frase final  
Kate’b’inoq  
**k – at – e’ – b’in – oq**  
Vas a (ir a) caminar.

Verbos transitivos:

TAM – Juego B – **MOV** – Juego A – Raíz  
Kojulkitzukuj.  
**k – oj – ul – ki – tzukuj**  
Ellos vienen a buscarnos.

TAM – Juego b – **MOV** – Juego A – Raíz – Sufijo – Marcador de frase final  

Ke’nk’utu’  
**k – ø – e’ – in – k’ut – u – ‘**  
Voy a (ir a) mostrar/enseñar.

**Excepciones:** Las excepciones se dan a menudo, en especial con la partícula –**e’** -, porque crea grupos de vocales. En estos casos se puede cambiar el orden del pronombre y la partícula de movimiento (MOV), pueden desaparecer vocales, o la –**e’** – se reduce y se inserta una glotal (**‘**), lo cual ya hemos visto antes:

*k-in-**e’** -uxlanoq  
Kinu**‘** xlanoq  
Voy a (ir a) descansar.

**Desaparece la vocal** : (desaparece la –i de –inw-)

*k-at-e’-(i)nw –il-a’

**Aquellos tiempos**

En aquellos tiempos cuando yo llegaba a quedarme en san Francisco, temprano me venía a traer mi papa para irnos; cargamos las piedras de moler para ir a venderlos. A veces en solo tres días ya teníamos vendido las piedras de moler, y a veces nos tardábamos en venderlos. A mi papa lo conocían muy bien en san Francisco porque desde hace tiempo la municipalidad le había dado permiso para vender allí, la gente de allí son muy buenos, el alojamiento no es pagado y también las puertas de las casas no están cerradas a los vendedores que no tienen alojamiento, porque en aquellos tiempos nadie robaba en las casas.

KEMCHI’Gramática

**Movimiento incorporado en construcciones pasivas y antipasivas**

El _movimiento incorporado_ siempre se refiere al agente de una frase, **nunca** al paciente. Nos referimos a agente y paciente aquí como _papeles semánticos_ , no gramaticales. Los agentes son entes que HACEN ALGO. Los pacientes entes A LOS QUE SE LES HACE ALGO.

El movimiento en k’iche’ siempre se refiere al agente del verbo, aunque no se exprese explícitamente en el verbo, como en construcciones pasivas. En el pasivo, la persona gramatical que se marca es el PACIENTE porque SE LES HACE ALGO, aunque convencionalmente a veces se le llama sujeto.

| **La silla** | **fue tomada** | **por la mujer**  
---|---|---|---  
Gramatical | sujeto | verbo pasivo | objeto oblicuo  
Semántico |  PACIENTE | verbo pasivo |  AGENTE  
  
En construcciones pasivas en k’iche’, se puede expresar movimiento incorporado, pero siempre se referirá al AGENTE, no al sujeto.

En construcciones antipasivas, el sujeto gramatical se refiere al AGENTE. En este caso, el movimiento se refiere al sujeto.

Ejemplos:

Xulk’ama le tem.

Xu’lelesaxoq.

Xu’lch’aya le taq tz’i’.

Xu’lelaq’axa k’u le e yo’xab’ chuwach ri kinan.

Xu’lch’aya le taq tz’i’ rumal le elaq’om.

Kulkunataja le yawab’.

Xojulloq’omana waral.

Kine’kamisaxa rumal le elaq’om.

Xe’k’ama ri tem.

Kine’t’uyuloq!

Kine’t’uyula pa le tem.

Are le ixoq ke’ilowoq.

Kine’kolowoq.

Kine’kanaja kan pa Xela.

Introducción

El perfecto tiene varios usos en k’iche’. Principalmente denota una acción que se han iniciado en el pasado, pero también tiene otros usos que estudiaremos en esta unidad.

TZIJONIKTexto

Nuestro ajtij Xwan nos cuenta una historia. Presten atención a los usos del perfecto y repáselos después de estudiar la sección de gramática.

KEMCHI’Gramática

Un verbo en este aspecto indica que la acción **empezó en el pasado, o que la acción o su efecto continúan en el presente.** Los verbos intransitivos y transitivos se dan en el perfecto a través del uso de diferentes sufijos.

Este aspecto se marca con un sufijo y **no** tiene prefijo de marcador de aspecto. El uso de los pronombres es igual a los otros verbos. En otras palabras, construcciones transitivas usan usan pronombres del Juego A (ergativo) **y** Juego B****(absolutivo) en el mismo orden que otrós verbos. Perfectos intransitivos se marcan con pronombres del Juego B únicamente.

**Raíces intransitivas**

Para las raíces intransitivas, pasivo II, y raíces _antipasivas_ , el perfecto se forma con el sufijo **–(i)naq**. El perfecto para los _posicionales_ se forma con **–(i)naq** usando la raíz adjetival/estativa que termina en **–Vl/Vn**. El sujeto se marca con absolutivos.

  1. In warnaq.  
__He dormido.__
  2. Uj kosnaq.  
__Estamos cansados.__
  3. Tak’alnaq.  
__Ha parado (un carro, el bus).__
  4. In kunatajnaq.  
__He sido curado__
  5. At to’tajnaq.  
__He sido curado.__
  6. At to’tajnaq.  
__Has sido ayudado.__
  7. In kunannaq.  
__He curado.__
  8. In in ch’ayowinaq.  
__Yo mismo he pegado.__
  9. In chakunaq kuk’.  
__He trabajado con ellos.__
  10. Jachin chiwe uj ilowinaq?  
_¿Quién de ustedes nos ha visto?  
_

**Raíces de verbos transitivos (CVC y no-CVC):**  
En voz activa y pasivo I, el sufijo del perfecto es –**om;** cuando la vocal de raíz es -u-, el sufijo es **–um**. En posición final la vocal del sufijo del perfecto se alarga (generalmente no se representa por escrito). Las raíces que terminan en glotal solamente añaden **–m**.

**Voz Activa**

**Transtitivos CVC**

  12. At wilom.  
__Yo te he visto.__
  13. Wilom.  
__Yo lo he visto.__
  14. Uj kilom.  
_Nos han visto._

**Transitivos No-CVC**

  15. At nutzukum.  
_Yo te he buscado.  
_
  16. In itzukum.  
__Ustedes me han buscado.__
  17. At qato’m.  
_Nosotros te hemos ayudado._

**Voz Pasiva:** para el perfecto pasivo no se alarga la raíz. Estas formas se distinguen de sus contrapartes activas por el uso de pronombres del juego B.

**CVC transitivos**

  18. In ilom.  
__He sido visto.__
  19. Wilom.  
_He visto._

  19. Uj ilom.  
__Hemos sido vistos.__
  20. Qilom.  
_Hemos visto._

  20. I’lom.  
__Ellos han sido vistos.__
  21. Kilom.  
_Ellos han visto._

**Transitivos No-CVC**

  22. In tzukum.  
__Yo he sido buscado.__
  23. Nutzukum.  
_Yo he buscado._

  24. E tzukum.  
__Ellos han sido buscados.__
  25. Tzukum alaq.  
__Ustedes (formal) han sido buscados.__
  26. At to’m.  
__Has sido ayudado.__
  27. Uj to’om.  
_Hemos sido ayudados._

Preste atención al marcador de persona verbal más cercano al verbo. Si es _ergativo,_ es el agente de una construcción transitiva; si es  _absolutivo_ , la forma es intransitiva y el pronombre indica un sujeto.

  28. Nuterne’em.  
__Yo lo he seguido.__
  29. In terne’em.  
_Yo he sido seguido._

**Uso del aspecto perfecto**

El aspecto perfecto expressa la idea de una acción que inición en el pasado pero que continua en el presente. Esto puede ser interpretado al español con la forma – _ando/-iendo._

  30. Warnaq le ak’al.  
__El niño__ _está durmiendo._
  31. We ne petnaq ri achi chanim.  
_Quizás el hombre está viniendo ahora._
  32. Jachin eqanaq la’ le si’?  
__¿Quién está cargando la leña ahí.__
  33. At qiye’m chanim.  
_Te estamos esperando._

**Adjetivo verbal  
**Verbos en aspecto perfecto se usan como adjetivos:

  34. kaminaq tz’i’  
__perro muerto__
  35. sachinaq achi  
_hombre perdido_

**Aspecto pluscuamperfecto**

El aspecto perfecto se traduce como pluscuamperfecto (había) cuando se usa con **chik**. A menudo aparece en una oración acompañada de una segunda frase verbal cuyo verbo está en el aspecto completo.

  36. Kaminaq chi ri achi are taq xujopan pa ro’ch.  
_El hombre ya había muerto cuando llegamos a su casa._
  37. Uj ch’ajanaq chik are taq xujiwil pa b’e.  
_Ya habíamos bañado cuando nos vieron en el camino._

**Aspecto futuro perfecto**

El aspecto perfecto se traduce como futuro perfecto (habrá) cuando se usa con **chik** y en una oración acompañada de una segunda frase verbal cuyo verbo está en aspecto incompleto.

  38. O’kinaq chi le ixoqib’ pa k’ayb’al are taq kujopan chweq.  
_Las mujeres ya habrán entrado al mercado cuando llegamos mañana._
  39. Rajawaxik ix ulinaq chik are taq kujb’e oj.  
_Es necesario que ustedes habrán llegado cuando nos vamos._
  40. We ne majim chi le chomal aretaq kujopanik.  
_Talvez la reunion ya habrá comenzado cuando llegamos._

Nota: el verbo **eta’maj**  
No sólo la raíz perfecta es un poco irregular (**eta’m**), en el aspecto perfecto el significado de eta’maj “aprender” cambia a “conocer.”

  40. Weta’am.  
_Lo sé._
  41. Reta’am.  
_Lo sabe._
  42. Eta’m alaq.  
_Ustedes (formal) lo saben._

Introducción

En k’iche’ algunos sustantivos cambian de forma cuando se poseen. En esta unidad veremos las posibles formas de los sustantivos poseídos.

TZIJONIKTexto

Pascual nos enseña el vocabulario de las partes del cuerpo:

En este video, Nela repasa algunas partes del cuerpo, poseídas en primera persona:

En este video, Mareike le pregunta a los estudiantes si les duelen ciertas partes del cuerpo:

KEMCHI’Gramática

  1. **Sustantivos que no cambian al poseerse.**

La mayoría de los sustantivos, simples o derivados, no cambian al poseerse:

wuj | libro | nuwuj | mi libro  
---|---|---|---  
pop | petate | apop | tu petate  
aj | elote, | waj | mi elote  
  
  2. **Sustantivos con cambio en la duración de vocal al poseerse.  
**En dialectos del k’iche’ que exhiben la variación en duración fonética de vocal, la vocal corta al final del sustantivo se convierte en vocal larga al poseerse. En esta clase, no representamos este cambio por escrito (en la tabla de abajo, las vocales largas están en negrita).

kinaq’ | frijoles | nukin**a** q’ | mis frijoles  
---|---|---|---  
pwaq | dinero | upw**a** q | su dinero (3ra persona singular)  
wakax | vaca | iwak**a** x | su vaca (2da persona plural)  
kar | pez | uk**a** r | su pez (3ra persona singular)  
tz’i’ | perro | atz’**i** ’ | tu perro  
ab’aj | piedra | kab**a** j | su piedra (3ra persona plural)  
  
  3. **Sustantivos que pierden sufijo al poseerse (-aj)  
**La mayoría de palabras correspondientes a partes del cuerpo en k’iche’ se deshacen del sufijo -aj al poseerse.

aqanaj _  
_ pierna, pie | iwaqan | su pierna  
---|---|---  
q’ab’aj  
mano, brazo | nuq’ab’ | mi mano, mi brazo  
uwi q’ab’aj  
dedos de la mano | uwi nuq’ab’ | sus dedos  
qulaj  
cuello | kiqul | sus cuellos  
jolomaj  
cabeza | nujolom | mi cabeza  
tza’maj  
nariz | utza’m | su nariz  
xkinaj  
oreja | qaxkin | nuestra(s) oreja(s)  
chi’aj  
boca | nuchi’ | mi boca  
xik’  
ala | uxik’ | su ala  
wi’aj  
pelo |  awi’ | tu pelo  
wachaj  
cara |  nuwach | mi cara  
b’aq’wachaj  
ojo |  kib’aq’wach | sus ojos  
pamaj  
estómago |  pam la | su estómago (2da persona singular, formal)  
k’u’xaj  
corazón (usa k’u’xaj: pecho) | nuk’u’x | mi corazón  
palajaj

ch’ekaj  
rodilla |  nuch’ek | mi rodilla  
ch’u’kaj  
codo |  nuch’u’k | mi codo  
ware’aj  
dientes, filo de un cuchillo | nuware’ | mis dientes  
  
**Plurales de partes del cuerpo compuestas + posesión**

le uwi q’ab’aj | dedo  
---|---  
le uwi taq q’ab’aj | dedos  
le uwi le nuq’ab’ | mi dedo  
le uwi taq le nuq’ab’ | mis dedos  
K’ax le uwi taq le nuq’ab’ | Me duelen los dedos.  
  
*Nótese, cuando _-wi’_ aparece como parte de una palabra compuesta (ej. _uwi q’ab’aj_) se pierde la glotal. Lo mismo acontece con _-chi’ > uchi ja._

**Palabras que no son partes del cuerpo pero también pierden el sufijo –aj**

q’u’aj | cobija | nuq’u’ (también: nuk’ul) | mi cobija  
---|---|---|---  
b’i’aj |  nombre | nub’i’ | mi nombre  
makaj |  pecado, falta | amak | tu pecado, tu falta  
k’asaj | deuda | nuk’as | mi deuda  
sokaj |  nido, cama | kisok | su cama (3ra persona plural)  
ch’akataj |  almohada | nuch’akat |  mi almohada  
  
**Términos de familia que pierden sufijo al poseerse:** La forma no poseída se usa al hablar de relaciones familiares en general, sin referirse a una relación en particular.

achajilom | esposo (pl.: e achajilom) | wachajil | mi esposo  
---|---|---|---  
ixoqilom | esposa (pl.: e ixoqilom) | wixoqil | mi esposa  
alk’walaxel (-ab’) | hijo(a) | walk’ual | mi hijo(a) (pl: e walk’ual)  
ji’axel (-ab’) | yerno | nuji’ | mi yerno  
chaq’ixel (-ab’) | hermano(a) mayor (del mismo sexo) | nuchaq’ | mi hermano(a) menor  
k’ajoloxel | hijo (de hombre) | nuk’ajol | mi hijo (de hombre)  
ula’xel | huésped | wula’ | mi huésped  
alb’atz (-ib’) | nuera | walib’ | mi nuera  
Qajawxel, k’ajoloxel, uxlab’ixel |  Padre, Hijo y Espíritu Santo  
  
**  
«Posesión inalienable» (sufijo –Vl)  
**La **posesión inalienable** indica que existe una relación intrínseca con el poseedor; o describe una cualidad del posesor. El sufijo indica que el sustantivo es inalienable: estos sustantivos indican una relación estrecha con el sustantivo que lo posee. Este mismo sufijo también se usa para derivar sustantivos abstractos.

ib’och’ | venas | **r** ib’och’**il** | sus venas (3ra personal sing)  
---|---|---|---  
sib’ | humo | **u** sib’**el** le q’aq’ | el humo del fuego  
kik’ | sangre | **nu** k’ik’**el** | mi sangre  
ajaw | señor | **r** ajaw**al** | señor de  
b’aq | hueso | **nu** b’aq**il** | mi cuerpo  
utz + wachaj |  bien + cara | **r** utz**il** wachaj | saludo  
che’ + -ij | árbol + espalda | **u** ch’e’**el** wij |  mi columna  
  
**Sustantivos que siempre se poseen.** Estos sustantivos suelen aparecer únicamente como sustantivos poseídos:

-xaq | hoja(s) | uxaq che’ | hojas de árbol  
---|---|---|---  
-a’ | pantorrilla | wa’ | mi pantorrilla  
-ij | espalda, cáscara | rij |  su espalda, su cáscara  
-je’ | cola | uje’ koj | la cola del león  
-al | hijo(a) (de mujer) | ral le al We’l | hija(o) deWe’l  
-achalal | hermanos(as) (pl: e -achalal) | e wachalal | mis hermanas(os)  
-achi’l | amigo, compañero (pl: e –achi’l) | e qachi’il | nuestros amigos  
  
**Suplentes** :  
Algunos sustantivos tienen una forma diferente (suplente) cuando se poseen:

ja | casa |  r-o’ch | su casa (3ra persona sing)  
---|---|---|---  
q’u’aj | cobija | nuq’u’/nuk’ul |  mi cobija  
  
**Sustantivos compuestos poseídos: u-SUSTANTIVO+SUSTANTIVO  
**Hay muchas palabras compuestas en k’iche’ en las que se combinan dos sustantivos, un sustantivo poseído seguido por el sustantivo del poseedor. Cuando estos sustantivos compuestos se poseen, el pronombre de posesión se añade al segundo elemento:

uchi ja | puerta (lit. la boca de la casa) | uchi **w** o’ch | mi puerta  
---|---|---|---  
uwi ja |  techo (lit. el pelo de la casa) | uwi **aw** o’ch |  su techo  
uxaq wuj | página(s) (lit. las hojas del libro) | uxaq **nu** wuj |  la(s) página(s) de mi libro  
  
**Nota:** recuérdese que **-o’ch** es la forma poseída de «casa» y se también se usa con los sustantivos compuestos.

upa ja |  familia |  upa **w** o’ch |  mi familia  
---|---|---|---  
  
**  
Sustantivo compuesto poseído:** atributo (+a) + sustantivo:

Kem + tz’ib’ | kematz’ib’ | nukematz’ib’ (neologismo) | mi computadora  
---|---|---|---  
Nim + q’ij | nimaq’ij | unimaq’ij | su fiesta  
Saq + po’t | saqapo’t | asaqapo’t | tu huipil blanco  
  
**Sustantivos compuestos poseídos:** sustantivo + sustantivos (pares)**  
** En pares se expresa un concepto con dos ideas, y ambas contribuyen al entendimiento del todo. Este es un dispositivo retórico muy común en idiomas mayas, en especial en lenguaje ceremonial y formal. Cuando se posee un par, ambos elementos se poseen:

Ati’t “ _grandmother_ ” + mam “ _grandfather_ ” | ancestros | qati’t qamam | nuestros ancestros  
---|---|---|---  
Nan “ _mother_ ” + tat “ _father_ ” | padres | qanan qatat | nuestros padres  
Il “ _sin_ ” + mak “ _fault_ ” |  ofensas | qil qamak | nuestras ofensas

# Tïjonïk 41: Oj ajwaral (We are from here) – Nominalizations

Introducción

**Nominalizaciones**

Las nominalizaciones son sustantivos que se derivan de raíces verbales. Es una clase de palabra muy utilizada en k’iche’. Se derivan tanto de verbos transitivos como intransitivos. La raíz verbal aporta su significado y transmite su valencia al sustantivo recién formado; dependiendo de la raíz de la que se originan, estos sustantivos pueden o no estar vinculados a un objeto directo, como veremos más adelante.

KEMCHI’Gramática

**Agentivos**

Los agentivos son sustantivos que se refieren a la persona que ejecuta la acción expresada por el verbo. Se traducen al español muchas veces como sustantivos terminados -or(a): profes-or(a), escrit-or(a), etc. En K’iche’ son de dos tipos: los que terminan con el sufijo –Vl, donde V es una vocal, y los que toman la partícula proclítica _aj_ al inicio.

Los agentivos, _con la excepción de aquellos formados por aj_ , pueden formarse a partir de raíces _transitivas_ o _intransitivas_ , pero no todas las raíces posibles sirven como bases para un agentivo. Por lo general _no_ se forman a partir del _antipasivo de enfoque_ ; las raíces verbales no-CVC no se usan como base para un agentivo (primero deben convertirse a la forma antipasiva). Con _posicionales_ , los agentivos se forman con la r _aíz adjetival/estativa_.

Los sustantivos agentivos conservan su valencia: la capacidad del sustantivo recién formado de vincularse a un objeto (o no) depende de la raíz en la que se basa el agentivo. Los sustantivos agentivos de una raíz transitiva pueden aparecer con un complemento directo; los complementos de los agentivos de raíces intransitivas tienen que aparecer como oblicuos.

Ahora explicamos la manera de formar agentivos:

**Agentivos con «aj»  
**Estos agentivos se marcan con _aj_ y aparecen con sustantivos, algunas raíces verbales, algunos adverbios (_waral_) y nombres de lugares. En su mayoría son gentilicios (_aj Nawalja’ –_ persona de Nahualá), ocupación (_aj chak_ – trabajador) y a veces propiedad.

ajtuj – comadrona

ajchak – trabajador

ajik’ – empleada (que se le paga por mes)

ajtij – maestro

ajch’ajo’n – lavandera

ajyuq’ – pastor (_yuq_ ‘ es solo una raíz verbal, ya no es un morfema libre)

ajk’ay – vendedor (nótese que en la mayoría de los dialectos, pero no en nahualá, ajk’ay coexiste con k’ayinel; k’ayinel también significa: traidor)

ajwaral – persona de aquí

ajchila’ – persona de allá

ajchi’ – persona de aquí mismo

aj’ikem – persona del sur

ajajsik – persona del norte (en Nahualá de _jorona juyub’_)

ajtaq’aj – persona de la costa (=aj’ikem)

ajNawalja’ – persona de Nahualá

ajChuwila’ – persona de Chichicastenango

ajSwan Tinamit – alguien del pueblo

ajkaminaq – la famlia de un recién fallecido

aj choq’e – dueño

Ajq’e – owner

Ajq’u’ – ghost (pl: ajq’u’ab’) (rajawal b’e)

**Agentivos intransitivos de raíces verbales intransitivas: -el  
**Los agentivos derivados de raíces verbales intransitivas llevan con el sufijo _-el_. Pueden formarse a partir de _verbos radicales intransitivos, raíces de antipasivo absolutivo y raíces pasivas._ A menudo los agentivos en – _el_ también llevan el prefijo _aj_ , en especial si se refieren a una actividad que la persona hace regularmente, como un trabajo u ocupación.

Los agentivos de _verbos transtitivos derivados_(no-CVC) siempre se forman con la raíz del antipasivo absolutivo.

Las raíces transitivas CVC tienen su propio sufijo – _Vl_ para formar agentivos (como veremos más abajo), pero también se pueden formar con la raíz antipasiva de los verbos CVC.

B’in  

b’inel – viajero  

ajb’inel – viajero (para negocios, con algún propósito)  

b’inel ja’ – agua en movimiento (ríos, riachuelos)

wa’katel – viajero

Como se mencionó anteriormente, el sustantivo agentivo conserva la valencia; si desea emplear un agentivo de una raíz transitiva, debe decidir si el nuevo sustantivo necesita controlar un objeto o no, y de acuerdo a esto, los sustantivos agentivos se forman a partir de la raíz transitiva activa (_-Vl_) o de la raíz antipasiva (con – _el_). En el primer caso, el complemento verbal se yuxtapone, incorporándose al agentivo. En el segundo, la nominalización con raíz antipasiva, el agentivo _no puede incorporar_ al complemento directo, sino que se puede introducir únicamente con una frase oblícua:

Aj xojolob’ – danzante

Elaq’aj  

elaq’om – ladrón  

elaq’anel – ladrón

También hay unos pocos agentivos que no se refieren al agente sino más bien al que sufre la acción que el verbo expresa. Los siguientes ejemplos provienen del habla ceremonial (pach’um tzij) y no se usan en el habla cotidiana.

Kam  

Kamel – mortal  

Oj kamel, xaq kojok’owik – somos mortales, solo vamos de paso

k’is  

k’isel – algo que tiene fin, que no es infinito (de la raíz pasiva)  

xaq oj k’isel pa we uwach ulew – somos pasajeros en esta tierra

q’ax  

q’axel – pasajero

**Nominalizaciones de verbos  
**Hay nominalizaciones verbales en k’iche’ que expresan la acción o experiencia expresada por el verbo o sus consecuencias. Por ejemplo: _b’inem_ (la acción de caminar, la _caminata_), _mayowem_ (la experiencia de preocuparse, la _preocupación_). Estos sustantivos se derivan de raíces verbales transitivas e intransitivas.

Para raíces intransitivas se usa el sufijo – _em._ Para posicionales, se usa el sufijo – _em_ con la raíz adjetival/estativa:

b’inem – caminada (la acción de caminar)

wa’katem- paseo (la acción de pasear)

okem – entrada (la acción de entrar)

mayowem – preocupación (la experiencia de preocuparse)

tak’alem – estar de pie

k’ulanem – el casamiento (la acción de casarse)

t’uyulem – estar sentado(a)

Excepción

waram – el sueño (la acción de dormir)  

xpe nuwaram – tengo sueño (lit: vino mi sueño)

Para los verbos transtitivos se utiliza el sufijo – _oj_ para verbos CVC. Para verbos no-CVC se utiliza el verbo «sin conjugar»

loq’oj – compra (la acción de comprar)  
Le a Lu’, k’i uwach uloq’oj xub’ano – Lu hizo muchas compras

chapoj ib’ – la acción de agarrarse (los unos a los otros) (o como en una pelea)

iloj – la acción de ver  
Xb’e pa iloj ab’ix – él fue a inspeccionar la milpa

sachoj ib’ – la acción de perderse (el uno al otro, varias personas)

k’ayij – venta (la acción de vender)

majij – el comienzo (la acción de comenzar, empezar)

mulij ib’ – junta (la acción de juntarse, congregarse)

k’aqoj ib’ – Dispararse (lanzarse unos a otros)

**Nominalizaciones con -ik  
**La mayoría de verbos en k’iche’ pueden derivar nominalizaciones añadiendo el sufijo _-ik_ a _raíces verbales intransitivas, pasivas_ o _antipasivas._ Estos sustantivos expresan las consecuencias de la acción expresada por el verbo desde la perspectiva del objeto (transitivos) o agente (intransitivos). Suelen ser parte de cláusulas de complemento o de objeto y se traducen al español usando construcciones no finitas.

Cuando el verbo principal es intransitivo, el sustantivo verbal dependiente debe presentarse de manera oblicua, usualmente con una frase introducida por las preposiciones _che_ o _pa._ Si el verbo principal es transitivo, el sustantivo verbal puede ir directamente después como objeto.

**Con verbos principales intransitivos:**

**Xb’e che** utzukuxik le ali  
Él fue a su-ser-buscada- de la muchacha.  
Él fue a buscar a la muchacha.

**Xojb’e pa** muxanik  
Fuimos a la-acción-de-nadar  
Fuimos a nadar.

**  
Con verbo principal transitivo:**

Xumajij **nu** yajik  
Empezó mi ser-regañado  
Él/ella empezó a regañarme

Las nominalizaciones también conservan un cierto sentido de transitividad y voz en su nuevo estatus como sustantivos, lo que significa que se debe prestar mucha atención a la raíz del sustantivo verbal para determinar el papel de los demás participantes en la frase.

Si el concepto expresado (en la oración complementaria) es _semánticamente transitivo_ , pero el enfoque está puesto en el objeto del concepto, el k’iche’ prefiere una construcción que involucre un _sustantivo verbal pasivo poseído_ (_pasivo I y II_). El poseedor corresponde al paciente (objeto) del evento.

Es necesario que te acostumbres a su-ser-comida de las tortillas.  
Es necesario que te acostumbres a comer tortillas.

Nim **u** b’antajik **le tinamit Nawalja’.**

Na xil ta la le **u** tikitajik **le anim**.

Si el énfasis se hace sobre un agente de un verbo transitivo, se usa la nominalización activa transitiva:

empezó acción-de-llorar la madre  
la madre empezó a llorar.

empezó su-ser-llorada su-cara la su-mama la muchacha  
a muchachá empezó a llorar por su madre

Si el verbo es _semánticamente intransitivo_ , el sustantivo verbal se forma con la raíz intransitiva o antipasiva, **no la pasiva _._** El sustantivo verbal no se refiere al objeto sino al sujeto del evento. Cuando el sustantivo verbal se posee, el poseedor es el sujeto del evento que se describe.

Introducción

**Modalidad en k’iche’**

En esta unidad, estudiaremos las expresiones condicionales en sus formas positiva y negativa, explorando cómo pueden llevar a diferentes tipos de consecuencias. Aparecerán, también, frases contrastantes.

Un concepto conocido como «modalidad» o «modo» permite a los hablantes expresar evaluaciones, actitudes o posturas ante los acontecimientos, en lugar de proporcionar contenido referencial. Esto incluye modos como el imperativo, exhortativo, potencial, subjuntivo y optativo, por ejemplo, que a menudo se refieren a acontecimientos que aún no existen en la realidad, pero que existen en los reinos de la imaginación, la posibilidad o el deseo.

El modo irreales, una parte de la modalidad, se utiliza para hablar de acontecimientos hipotéticos o irreales, indicando al oyente que estos acontecimientos son (aún) imaginarios. Por ejemplo, en enunciados condicionales como «Si hubieras hecho esto, esto otro habría sucedido», hablamos de un acontecimiento que no ha sucedido y que tal vez nunca suceda, utilizando irreales para expresar su naturaleza hipotética.

Por el contrario, algunas oraciones condicionales reflejan escenarios del mundo real, como «Si haces esto, esto sucederá». Estos condicionales no entran dentro de los irreales y no están marcados como tales en lenguas como el k’iche’.

KEMCHI’Gramática

**Partes principales** :

En k’iche’ los condicionales se expresan con una combinación de marcadores de aspecto pre-verbales y partículas sueltas.

**TA** : Esta partícula aparece después del verbo y eleva el evento a un evento imaginario, irreales. Se utiliza junto con otras partículas en oraciones condicionales.

**LA’/WA’** : Este pronombre demostrativo a menudo indica condicionales. La mayoría del tiempo se encuentra en la cláusula de consecuencia (Si hubieras hecho esto, esto otro (LA’) hubiera pasado). Indica que el evento podría o pudo haber pasado.

**WE** : Esta partícula introduce cláusulas condicionales (si…); a menudo el verbo que la sigue lleva ch- como marcador de aspecto.

**B’A** : Partícula que expresa esperanza de que el evento se lleve a cabo; aparece después del verbo en combinación con **TA (TA B’A)**

**NE:** Partícula que expresa posibilidad; aparece después del verbo en combinación con **TA (TA NE);** o después de **WE** para formar **WE NE** : tal vez

**MA** : **MA** marca negación en todos los contextos que no son indicativos****(en vez de **NA**)

**CONDITIONALS**

En k’iche’, las cláusulas condicionales como estas son reflejos del mundo “real” y, por lo tanto, no se denota con un marcador irreales. La partícula principal de las condicionales es **we** ; el verbo generalmente toma el marcador de aspecto **ch-**.

**Condicionales Positivos  
**_Si haces esto, esto otro va a pasar…_

We chatchakunik, k’o awa.  
Si vas a trabajar, tienes comida.

We chab’ij, na katinch’ab’ej ta chik.  
Si vas a decir, ya no te voy a hablar.

We chojb’e pa le nimaq’ij, keqil le ajxojolob’.  
Si vamos a la feria, veremos a los bailadores.

**Condicionales Negativos  
**_Si no haces esto, esto (no) va a pasar_

**wemna** \+ subjuntivo/verbo dependiente:

Wemna chpe le jab’ kakam le ab’ix.  
Si no viene la lluvia se muere la milpa.

Wemna chaloq’ axiyal, na kinb’e ta awuk’.  
Si no te compras un abrigo, no iré contigo.

Wemna chatijoj awib’, na kach’ak ta le atijonik.  
Si no estudias, no ganarás tu lección.

Wemna kujb’ek kab’ison le qatat.  
Si no vamos, se pondrá triste nuestro padre.

Wemna chinak’amo, kinb’an ayab’.

Wemna chpe le jab’ kakam le ab’ix.

Wemna chaloq’ axiyal, na kinb’e ta awuk’.

Wemna chatijoj awib’, na kach’ak ta le atijonik.

Wemna kujb’ek kab’ison qatat.

**Condicionales de contraste  
**_Aunque se hizo esto, sucede esto_

Esta construcción se marca con las partículas **pi ne ta ne** or **are ta + x-E-aj** antes del verbo.

**Pi ne ta ne**

Pine ta ne maj nurajil, kimb’e wi.  
Aunque no tenga dinero, iré (de todas formas).

Pine ta ne kinitzapij pa che’ kintor wib’.  
Aunque me encierren en la carcel, saldré (lit: me abriré).

Pine ta ne kape le qatat na kinxe’j ta wib’.  
Aunque venga mi padre, no me asustaré.

Pine ta ne maj le ajkun, na kinkam ta wi.  
Aunque no esté el doctor, no moriré.

Pine ta ne kekamsax le tz’i’, na kek’is ta wi.

Pine ta ne kixxuki’ chinuwach na kinkuy ta imak.

Pine ta ne kinab’ochi’ij na kawaj ta wi.

Después de**are ta** aparece una forma completiva del verbo **aj**(querer), que concuerda con el sujeto o agente de la cláusula.

Are ta xraj le tz’i’ xok pa le jul, par na xkowin taj rumal sib’alaj nim.  
Quiso entrar el perro en el hoyo, pero no pudo porque es muy grande.

Are ta xiwaj xixb’ixanik par na utz ta le iqul.  
Ustedes quisieron cantar pero sus voces no son buenas.

Are ta xkaj le winaq xewa’ik, par maj chi re rikil.  
Las personas quisieron comer, pero ya no había comida.

Ri tz’ikin are ta xraj xuk’is tzij puwi’ ri ali, chema ma k’u xkam ta ri ali, xa ne xaq xew ri tz’ikin xkamik (rey de los reyes: 50)

Ri ala sib’alaj xsach uk’u’x aretaq xuto chi chpam ri nimalaj ul kachach wi ri ranab’, karaj ta chik resam ri ranab’ loq; chema ma kakowin ta k’ut kaqaj b’i chpam ma sib’alaj k’ax xuq nim xulanik. (rey de los Reyes:52)

**Condicional de contraste + negación****  
**_Aunque no se haga esto, sucederá esto._

**Pinemna**

Pinemna kab’e le watz, kimb’e wi in pa ka’yib’al.  
Aunque no vaya mi hermano, yo iré (de todas maneras) al mercado.

Kinya wa’ we ch’ich’, pinemna utz.  
Voy a dar este machete, aunque no sea bueno.

**Condicional/irreales  
**_Si hubieras hecho esto, esto hubiera pasado._

La condición se presenta con **we ta.** La consecuencia o resultado posible en la cláusula que sigue se marca con **ta + (partícula deíctica) la’.** Nótese que los verbos aparecen en aspecto completivo.

**We ta** xatb’e wuk’ pa le tinamit, xaloq’ **ta la’** le ujastaq le ak’ajol  
Si hubieras ido conmigo al pueblo, hubieras comprado la ropa de tu hijo.

**We ta** xatb’e wuk’ pa le tinamit, xaloq’ **ta wa’** we jastaq  
Si hubieras ido conmigo al pueblo, hubieras comprado esta ropa.

**Condicional/irreales + negación**  
_Si (no) hubieras hecho esto, no hubieras…_

La negación se forma con las partículas **ma ta**.

Si la **cláusula condicional** se niega (si no hubieras), la partícula de negación **ma ta** aparece después de **we ta** para formar: **we ta ma ta:** Si no hubieras…

We ta ma ta xatb’e pa le tinamit ma ta xaloq’ la’ le ujastaq le ak’ajol.  
Si no hubieras ido al pueblo, no hubieras comprado la ropa de tu hijo.

We ta ma ta xinawilo ma ta kinya b’e la’ chawech.  
Si no me hubieras visto, no te hubiera dado permiso.

We ta ma ta xinpetik, in k’o ta wa’ chwa wo’ch.  
Si no hubiera venido, estaría en mi casa.

We ta ma ta xpe alaq, k’o ta alaq la’ chwa ja.  
Si no hubieran venido, estarían en la casa.

Cuando se niega la cláusula de consecuencia, **ma ta** pasa al frente del verbo o el elemento que se niega, la partícula deíctica se mantiene después del verbo o elemento que se niega.

We ta xakunaj le atat ma ta xkam la’.  
Si hubieras curado a tu papá, no se hubiera muerto.

We ta xanimaj jas le xinb’ij chawech, ma ta je la’ la’ xab’ano.  
Si me hubieras hecho caso, no estarías así.

En casos en los cuales la cláusula de consecuencia incluye la negación de **k’o** (=maj), el marcador de negación **ma** se combina con **maj** , solo queda **ta** :

We ta ma ta aq’ab’ kab’ek, maj ta utem la’ kuriq pa le nimach’ich’.

Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn how to make tortillas by following a step-by-step description from a K’iche’ speaker who explains the traditional process. Pay close attention to the order of each step, the tools that are used, and the importance of each action. As you listen or read, write down any new vocabulary you learn, especially words related to cooking, daily routines, and cultural practices. We will also discuss the meaning of some key words and expressions in K’iche’ in the vocabulary section. Making tortillas is more than just preparing food—it is part of everyday life, identity, and family tradition.

Show/Hide English translation

Good morning to everyone. Now I want to show you the process of making tortillas, what is needed to make tortillas. I prepared my nixtamal yesterday—it was boiled, the nixtamal was cooked. Now I proceed to take my nixtamal and place it in a container. Then I wash it in a strainer-like container—I have a strainer-type container for washing it. I rinse it thoroughly until I feel that there are no more residues from the nixtamalization (a solution of water and lime used to remove the corn husk). After that, I put it in my container.

This is how I prepare it for grinding. Then I add a bit more nixtamal and water again. It needs to be ground very, very well so it can be better enjoyed. We need to grind it two or three times so it can be properly made into tortillas. We cut our dough into pieces, making sure there are no chunks of nixtamal left in it. After cutting the dough into pieces, I clean my grinding stone. After cleaning the handle of the grinding stone, I leave it on my cutting board. Then I proceed to clean the area where the nixtamal was ground on my grinding stone. I clean it well so no dough residue remains. After cleaning my grinding stone, I store it away.

After putting away everything I used, I proceed to light the fire. I place the firewood. I have lime to rub on my griddle so the tortillas will come out well. After rubbing the lime on the griddle, I place it over the fire and wait about half an hour for it to heat up. Once the griddle is hot, I proceed to make the tortillas. Right now, the griddle has heated up. Water is necessary so I can knead my dough. Now I begin to shape the dough into balls—this helps make the tortillas nice and round. Then I proceed to flatten them. I press the dough a little, then shape the edges so they don’t come out uneven—to make sure the edges come out perfect. Then I flatten again.

After flattening the dough, I see that the edges look good. Then I pour a little water on the griddle to check if it’s hot—it is. I place the tortilla on the griddle. It still needs a bit more time. Then I remove the tortilla—it’s cooked! It puffed up a bit, came out very, very well. Then I have my basket and my cloth napkin. I place the tortilla inside so it doesn’t get cold. The first one is cooked, then the next. It puffed up a lot. When that happens—when it puffs up a lot—it tastes much better.

After making the tortillas, I cover them well so they don’t get cold. That’s how the tortilla-making process is done. For us, it has a very important meaning, because that’s why we are strong, that’s why we move, that’s why we work. That’s why it is so important. Thank you very much for watching me, for listening to me. Goodbye.

Introducción

En esta lección, aprenderemos sobre el calendario maya y su importancia cultural a través de las palabras de una persona maya que explica su estructura, su significado espiritual y su situación actual. Presta mucha atención a cómo está organizado el calendario, por qué ciertos números son importantes y cómo se conecta con el cuerpo y el espíritu. Mientras escuchas o lees, toma nota de cualquier vocabulario nuevo relacionado con la medición del tiempo, las tradiciones y el conocimiento cultural. En la sección de vocabulario, también exploraremos algunos términos clave en k’iche’ relacionados con este tema. El calendario maya es más que una forma de medir el tiempo: refleja una visión del mundo, una conexión con los antepasados y un sistema de conocimiento que sigue vivo a través de los guías espirituales y las prácticas comunitarias.

**¿Qué es el calendario maya?**

El calendario maya: para entender el calendario maya, decimos que está cargado por 13 meses, ¿por qué 13? porque nuestros ancestros dicen que 13 articulaciones tiene el cuerpo humano, cada mes está compuesto por 20 días, ¿por qué 20 días?, porque el 20 representa el sistema numérico vigesimal en nuestra cultura, también; ante nuestros ancestros si contamos nuestros dedos de las manos junto con los de los pies, nos da de resultado el número 20, también el numero 20 está cargado por 20 nawales, cada día tiene su propio nawal, cada nawal puede predecirnos nuestro destino en la tierra, aquí es donde entra el guía espiritual, él puede ver a través del nawal cuál es nuestro tipo de pensamiento, cual es nuestra manera de actuar, que se nos ha otorgado antes de haber nacido, cuando hay alguien a quien no le va bien en la vida, puede ofrecer una ofrenda para enmendar su dia de naciemiento y su nawal y mejorar su vida, de último quiero decir que si multiplicamos 13 veces el numero 20, nos da como resultado 260, dicen nuestros ancestros que el numero 260 es el número de días que nos mantenemos en el vientre de nuestra madre antes de nacer en este precioso mundo.

**¿Aún se utiliza el calendario maya en la actualidad?**

Ya no es utilizado, cuando uno va a los mercados, cuando uno va a las escuelas, en las comunidades, ya no logra escuchar, ubicar que se utilice este calendario maya, en la actualidad se utiliza el calendario gregoriano, uno de las motivos de esto puede ser la Iglesia, porque que en la actualidad se usa como guía el día de los santos en el calendario, por eso las personas prácticamente han cambiado en sus pensamientos este calendario maya. Pero una de las cosas en donde se encuentra, se observa el calendario maya, es con los guías espirituales, con los guías espirituales porque en la ofrenda, costumbre, eso es lo que ellos emplean, eso es su trabajo, de eso depende sus conclusiones, por eso si uno acude ahí, logra percibir el uso del calendario maya.

**¿Qué se puede hacer para impulsar de nuevo el uso de este calendario maya?**

Hay mucho que podemos hacer, una de las cosas que se necesita, es que sea la municipalidad quien encabece; la municipalidad porque es quien gestiona la economía y después de dar la orden en las escuelas, todos los establecimientos del pueblo, es ahí donde se impulsa poco a poco los niños, jóvenes para que resurja nuestra manera de actuar, nuestra manera de pensar, de donde provenimos, en donde fue el comienzo de ese pasado de como es el tipo de costumbre y creencias de nuestros ancestros. De ahí comienza esto, después; si los jóvenes, niños ya conocen todo esto, después, podemos decir que ya se puede empezar entonces a emplear el calendario maya. Pero ya tenemos conocimiento del por qué, cual es el significado de esto, pienso que desde ahí es necesario que se impulse esto primero. También en los hogares, también en las comunidades, en los mercados, ahí es donde se le impulsa fuertemente pero nuestras costumbres, nuestras creencias resurgen en la escuela.

Introducción

En esta lección—la primera de dos sobre la migración—escucharemos a un hablante de k’iche’ explicar algunas de las razones por las cuales muchas personas de su comunidad han migrado a los Estados Unidos. Presta mucha atención a cómo describe los impactos económicos, sociales y emocionales de la migración, tanto positivos como negativos. Mientras escuchas o lees, anota cualquier palabra nueva que aprendas, especialmente aquellas relacionadas con el trabajo, el dinero, la vida familiar y las emociones. También hablaremos de algunas expresiones clave en k’iche’ en la sección de vocabulario. Migrar no es solo trasladarse de un país a otro—también representa un cambio importante en la vida de las personas, las familias y toda la comunidad.

Quiero dialogar brevemente a cerca de la migración a Estados Unidos, en la actualidad, muchos han migrado a estados unidos, han migrado hombres y mujeres, padres y madres de familia, pero por qué ocurrió este fenómeno en nuestro pueblo. Ocurrió por el sufrimiento que se vivía en nuestro pueblo para sobrevivir, no había trabajo, no había alimentos para comer, es por eso que pensaron en buscar una manera de sobrevivir en otro país. Hoy en día, muchos hombres radican halla, y se refleja cuando se realizaron las elecciones electorales, fueron más mujeres en los comicios a diferencia de los hombre, esto nos indica que son muchos los hombres que han migrado halla.

**¿Cuáles son las cosas positivas que han dejado la migración a Estados Unidos?**

Uno de las cosas positivas de la migración, es la construcción de casas, la mayoría de los que han migrado a Estados Unidos, están construyendo casas de dos o tres niveles, otra es la familia; se está viendo enormes cambios en la familia porque ya cuentan con los medios económicos para comprar y abastecerse de lo quieran comer. También ya cuentan con los medios económicos para que puedan comprarse ropa. También casi todos están invirtiendo en bienes raíces en nuestro pueblo para agrandar sus posesiones, también muchos están invirtiendo en algún negocio y que puedan hacer otras cosas para expandir sus bienes. También ha ayudado mucho en la economía del pueblo ya que muchos pero muchos de los que han migrado a Estado Unidos están guardando grandes sumas de dinero en los bancos locales del pueblo. Eso es eso.

**¿Cuáles son las cosas negativas que han dejado la migración a Estados Unidos?**

Uno de las cosas negativas es el divorcio en la familia, cuando el esposo migra a Estados Unidos en muchas ocasiones pierde la comunicación con la familia o se casa nuevamente halla, se olvida de su verdadera familia, se queda la mujer con sus hijos y encima de ellos una gran deuda, caen en desesperación y no hallan que hacer ya que el dinero que se usa para pagar su viaje; es prestado, vienen los bancos o las personas particulares con quienes han adquirido el préstamo, embargan la casa, terreno o el bien posesorio que han dado en garantía. Después quien sufre las consecuencias es la niñez, ya que pierden el sentido de sus vidas y caen en vicios, o ya no hay nadie que velen por ellos, otro de las cosas negativas es la juventud ya que tienen ya medios económicos, poseen carros, ya le dan menos importancia a su formación escolar. Desertan con sus compañeros y caen en vicios, después, lo otro son los migrantes que regresan, muchos de los que se regresan ya no se hallan aquí, vienen por un mes o dos meses y se regresan nuevamente a Estados Unidos, también muchos de los que se regresan pierden nuestra identidad acá, se vuelven orgullosos, ya no hablan nuestro idioma, pierden nuestra vestimenta, eso es lo que yo veo que está causando un gran daño a nuestro pueblo en la actualidad.

**¿Qué cambio se ha dado en el pueblo con la migración a Estados Unidos?**

Lo que vemos acá, la transformación, nuestro pueblo no era así antes, así como cuando nosotros crecimos, así es, no habían casas como los que hay, así como ahora ya como que hay un cambio, han podido construir sus casitas, han podido comprar pequeños terrenos, eso es el cambio de los que migran halla.

**¿Está mejor si uno migra a Estados Unidos?**

A veces está bien migrar halla y a veces en parte no, porque a veces van a ir desperdiciar su vida allí, sabemos que allí hay muchos vicios, muchos caen en el vicio del alcohol, hacen otras cosas y dejan a un lado sus metas y objetivos, pero también si se es consciente todas las cosas salen bien, las humildes necesidades que llevas planteado; se logran, pero si no se es consciente uno se vuelve o se vuelven alcohólico y entre otras cosas que hacen y es así como a veces se encuentran con su muerte ahí, regresan muertos, y es más que utilicen su conciencia eso es lo que puedo decir.

**¿Qué cosas negativas sufre la familia que se queda cuando alguien migra a Estados Unidos?**

Lo negativo que se da más, así como cuando uno deja su casa en garantía y si no es solventado la deuda, los familiares son desalojados todos, y eso es lo negativo porque si uno ha dejado hijos, ya no vela por ellos desde halla, así es, más son los niñitos que se han quedado los que sufren todo.

**¿Por qué la gente migra a Estados Unidos?**

Si el papa esta acá; y si no tiene estudios académicos, no puede darle una formación académica a su hijo (a) porque acá no se gana mucho, si la mama hace costura: no gana mucho y si el papa se va de jornalero también no gana mucho, en cambio si el papa migra halla la familia mejora sus condiciones, ya tiene algo que comer, ya tienen algo de cosas, se les construirá su casa.

**¿Está mejor las condiciones de vida de la familia cuando uno migra a Estados Unidos?**

A veces está mejor y a veces digamos que se desintegra, porque así como decimos es la conciencia del hombre, si es consiente entonces es bueno, pero si en dado caso no, entonces ahí es cuando a veces se da la disfunción familiar, y también la mujer digamos que si se da a respetar. Y si no se da a respetar entonces ahí es de donde surgen los problemas, ahí es en donde digamos que como que se desintegran, se accede a un divorcio. Así es eso.

**¿Qué tipo de dificultad sufren los niños cuando se da un divorcio entre los padres?**

Así es, si encuentran dificultades porque así como digo si se llega a esas cosas el esposo cambia, cae en el vicio del alcohol allí, y ahí como que se olvidan de los hijos ya no se preocupan por ellos y ahí es cuando sufren los niños.

**¿Cómo le hizo usted para buscar el dinero que se usó por haber sido trasladado sus hijos?**

Solo lo prestamos, y nos fue dado ahí en donde lo solicitamos, siendo sincero, gracias a Dios no me pidieron intereses, solo me dieron el prestamos, gracias a Dios que pudieron; mi hija si pudo pagar lo de ella, pero como ella no recorrió el viaje completo, si no que obtuvo acceso a otra alternativa y por eso es que pudo pasar y pago su deuda, ahora mi último hijo, él logro pagar lo de él, gracias a Dios pudo pagar lo de él, y él me ha estado ayudando algo en la actualidad, no es una gran cantidad lo que me manda pero me está ayudando en mis necesidades, porque yo, así como digo soy viudo, mi esposa murió, no tengo a nadie conmigo en la actualidad, tengo a mis hijos pero todos ellos tienen a su propia familia, y ellos están velando por mi hasta el día de hoy, gracias a Dios mi hijito que esta halla me esta ayudando algo en la actualidad, él está siendo bendecido ahí; veo yo, y le estoy agradecido a Dios que el este así, solo por sus necesidades el migro, porque nosotros acá no tenemos terrenos, no tenemos terrenos donde podamos construir nuestra casa, entonces el me comentaba a mí; me voy, y voy a buscar la manera de encontrar el dinero para que tengan su casa, para que ustedes tengan bienestar dice, entonces en la actualidad el ya solvento su deuda, ya empezó a ganar su dinero para un espacio donde estar. Esperamos en Dios, que nos tiene preparado a nosotros, si aún me mantengo con vida y entonces veré todavía donde se establecerá, y eso es lo que puedo decirles, así es, gracias, gracias a ustedes por las preguntas que me están haciendo, aclarare esto porque Dios tiene un propósito en mí, no solo es así porque si, también no puedo decir que mi hijo está sufriendo halla, no! También no digo que si tiene mucho dinero, no! Gracias a Dios a veces tiene, otras veces ni trabajo tiene. Así se ha mantenido en la actualidad, estoy feliz de este hijito que tengo halla, eso es lo poco que puedo decir.
